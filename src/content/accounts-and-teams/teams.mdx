## Create a Team

Creating a team requires that you have first created a workspace (See [Workspaces](/workspaces/workspace-create) for full details).

To create a team: 

1. Navigate to Teams in the main menu
2. Click "New Team"

<BlockImage src={img1} alt="New Team button"></BlockImage>

You are then presented with the Add New Team form: 

<BlockImage src={img2} alt="Add New Team form"></BlockImage>

A Team name is required while the description is optional.  "Visibility" controls if non-members can see the team or not: 

|         |                                  |
| :------ | :------------------------------- |
| Visible | non-members can view the team    |
| Hidden  | non-members cannot view the team |
