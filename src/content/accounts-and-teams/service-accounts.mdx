# Service Accounts

Services let you to create a Cloudsmith API Key not tied to a specific user. Services are ideal for any use case where you have automated processes (such as a CI/CD pipeline or similar) that requires write access to a repository. 

If your use case only requires pull or read access to a repository, use an [Entitlement Token](/software-distribution/entitlement-tokens).  

<Note variant="note">
  To create or manage Services for your organization, you need to have Owner or Manager permissions.
</Note>

## Creating a Service

To create a Service, go to Services on your Cloudsmith organization's accounts page, and click "Create Service":

<BlockImage src={img_Screenshot_2024_10_18_at_17_04_58} alt="Accounts section"></BlockImage>

Fill out the service form, and give your serice a name. Optionally, add a description and select any teams in your organization to associate with the service. 

<BlockImage src={img_Screenshot_2024_10_18_at_16_10_15} alt="Create service men"></BlockImage>

Once you create your service account, Cloudsmith will assign a `slug`, which will be used as an API-level identifier for the account. Note that service account slugs are automatically truncated at 30 characters, and may have random characters appended to ensure uniqueness.

## Getting a Service Username

The Service username is displayed in the NAME column:

## Getting a Service API Key

Copy Your API Key Immediately:

- Immediately copy the API key to your clipboard after it is created and store it securely.
- You will not be able to retrieve the API key again from Cloudsmith. However, you can rotate the key if needed.

<Note variant="note" headline="Securely Store Your API Key">
  Use a trusted password manager or a dedicated secrets vault to store your API key securely.
</Note>

## Refreshing a Service API Key

If you lose the API key associated with a Service account, or suspect it has been compromised, you'll need to refresh the key, generating a new one. To do this, go to the Accounts->Services section of our app. Under the API KEY column select the affected key, and click the "Refresh API Key" button to generate a new API key. 

<BlockImage src={img_Screenshot_2024_10_18_at_16_07_38_copy} alt="Service accounts menu, refresh API key"></BlockImage>

You must then confirm that you wish to refresh the Service API Key
