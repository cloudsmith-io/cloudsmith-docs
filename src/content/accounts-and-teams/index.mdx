# Teams and Accounts

In Cloudsmith, you can define the identities (Accounts and Teams) and their privileges within your Workspaces with a high level of detail.

There are two different types of **accounts**: 
- **Members**: use them to give access to humans in your organization.
- **Services**: for any automation or agents that might require access to your Workspaces.

Effective account **privileges** are divided into three main levels: 
- Workspace
- Team
- Repository

Learn more about them in the [Teams and Account's privileges](/accounts-and-teams/about-privileges) documentation or in the Workspace or Repository settings.
