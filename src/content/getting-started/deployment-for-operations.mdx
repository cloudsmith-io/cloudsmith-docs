## Provenance: Promote Assets for Deployment

Use webhooks to automate deployment pipelines and promote assets. On Cloudsmith, you can mirror your production pipeline and manage assets in logical groupings such as development, test, staging, and production.

Once you upload an asset, you can move it from development -> test -> staging -> production keeping the integrity of the asset and a provenance trail, without the bandwidth cost of downloading from staging and then re-uploading to production.
