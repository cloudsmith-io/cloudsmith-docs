# Dependencies (for Developers)

Cloudsmith allows you to manage all your software assets within a single platform. With over 20 formats, no matter what you are developing; Cloudsmith can help simplify and accelerate your development pipelines.

We are building Cloudsmith to provide universal format support for all package types. Which is no easy feat, but we love a challenge! Along with support for the more widely-used formats like Maven, npm and Docker we've recently rolled out support for Rust, Dart and LuaRocks. Our goal is to support developers no matter which technologies they are using.
