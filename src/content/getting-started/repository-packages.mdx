# Repository Packages

Packages are a logical grouping of files containing software and metadata about the software and its dependencies. Packages are typically versioned to provide a better and more manageable understanding of what software is being deployed.

As complexity grows; particularly with popular formats such as Maven and npm it becomes important to manage packages through a package management system such as Cloudsmith.

Cloudsmith supports packages (and containers) of many types, supporting native ingress and egress, to allow you full visibility of packages deployed in your development and production environments.

With Cloudsmith, you can automate the publishing and delivery of packages through native interface (e.g using "maven publish"), or through the Cloudsmith CLI, API or manually through the UI.

> Promote Packages
> Cloudsmith allows you to "promote" packages between repositories through either a [move](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/move-a-package) or [copy](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/copy-a-package) function, preventing unnecessary uploads/downloads, for an accelerated pipeline.
