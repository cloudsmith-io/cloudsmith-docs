## Artifact Management

Artifat management, sometimes called package management, is the process of handling the many and varied dependencies and artifacts for your servers, applications, and developers. These are the archives, binaries, libraries, tools, scripts, modules, snippets, metadata, assets and even datasets that power your processes, products, and solutions.

A binary package manager centralises these dependencies and artifacts, acting as a glue layer within the DevOps toolchain to provide easier interaction between development, operations, build, and release. 

Package management reduces the friction between different functions within DevOps, and the process of delivering from developer to customer is accelerated.

## Cloudsmith

Cloudsmith supports modern engineering workflows by acting as a single source of truth for your software artifacts. All your packages, in any format, are in one location and accessible across the organization. 

## Control

Cloudsmith provides well-defined controls (such as Role-Based Access Controls) for getting packages in and out, as well as controlling promotions, rollbacks, and deployments; so you can lock down who can do what, where, and when.

## Visibility

Cloudsmith provides you with a world view to see the attributes (i.e. names, versions, types, metadata) and state of play across all of your packages, regardless of type/source; so you can see and discover all there is know about the packages you use.

## Universality

Cloudsmith "speaks" the native protocol for a large number of packaging technologies (e.g. Python + Ruby + Maven/Java, etc.), as well provide APIs for easy/agnostic manipulation; so you have immediate compatibility with all of your tools.

## Security

Cloudsmith is built to be secure by default without having to define and set it up (e.g. encrypted-in-transit, at-rest, automated GPG/RSA signing, sane permissions, etc.); so you can shift security to the left and incorporate it as early as possible.

## Provenance

Cloudsmith provides traceability for current and previous versions of packages (i.e. source of package, dependencies, environment state, etc.); so you can know and prove the origin of the software that you use.

## Auditability

Cloudsmith provides you with access logs, metrics/statistics, and accountability for uploads and downloads in the system; so that you can ensure the right people are accessing the right things in the right way.

## Speed

Cloudsmith provides ultra-fast and worldwide distribution for packages as a standard feature with "at edge" distribution; so that you can get your packages to where they need to go at high-velocity.

## Isolation

Cloudsmith provides an additional layer in front of public services to ensure you can still get your packages when the public service is down; so you can remain up and working when they're down.

## Collaboration

Cloudsmith allows you to synchronize workflow and process with colleagues, other teams, and outside collaborators; so you can build community and collaboration with colleagues.

## Total Cost of Ownership

Cloudsmith is cheaper than planning it, coding it, maintaining it, upgrading it, and worrying about it, yourself; so you can concentrate on building and deploying your awesome products instead.

## Multi-format repositories

Cloudsmith supports storing multiple package types and container images in the same repository while still providing support for the native package management tooling for each format. 
 
* Repositories can be provisioned via UI, API or the Cloudsmith Terraform Provider.
* Unified Access controls, visibility and reporting.
* All artifacts are served through the Cloudsmith Package Delivery Network


## Upstream Proxying & Caching
Cloudsmith repositories support configuration of multiple upstream sources. 

Can be configured via UI, API or the Cloudsmith Terraform Provider.
Requests for packages that are not present in the repository will be served from an upstream source.
Packages can be proxied, or cached for subsequent requests.
Upstreams can be configured for resolution priority. 
Packages fetched from upstreams are tagged
