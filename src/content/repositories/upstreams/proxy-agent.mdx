# Upstream Proxy Agent
## Why Am I Here?

If you've received requests from a service you maintain with the user agent:

```
cloudsmith/x.y.z (+https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/proxy-agent)
```
Then you may be wondering what that means! If so, you're in the right place.

## What Is This?

Cloudsmith is a fully-managed, cloud-native software artifact management SaaS. We provide software supply chain security and artifact distribution for enterprises.

### Sounds great! Why have you been connecting to us?

If you've received a request from us with the user agent above, it means that one of our users has designated your service as an [Upstream](/repositories/upstreams). 

Upstreams allow our customers to proxy and cache artifacts from "upstream" registries in their Cloudsmith repositories. Many of our cusotmers' upstreams point to OSS registries like pypi, or Maven Central.

Using upstreams allows our customers to isolate their processes from issues - such as a registry or artifact becoming suddenly unavailable, which would otherwise cause their builds to fail. Using upstreams also allows customers to scan and inspect artifacts before they get to users - mitigating against supply-chain attacks. Upsteaams are ctitical in helping our customers centralize where their dependencies and software assets are maintained.

We speak to your service using the regular/native package manager interfaces to create awareness of what users can retrieve (and create an internal index). We'll generally connect on a cadence to keep in synchronization with the repository, too, so that we're working off the most accurate and up-to-date information. We also strive to be good citizens and obey conventions such as rate limits, with exponential back-off in place for most error handling.

### Can I speak to someone about this?

Of course! If you have any questions, concerns, or commercial obligations/terms - please Contact Us. We're on hand and always willing to help.
