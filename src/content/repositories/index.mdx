# Repositories

A Repository, or repo, is a storage location for software packages and containers.

Cloudsmith provides polyglot repositories that can contain packages of all support types. You can create an unlimited number of repositories; providing you with the flexibility to suit any use-case.

<Note variant="note">
  At Cloudsmith we use "repository" as a general term. We also refer to "registry" and "feed" in line with the format's specific nomenclature.

## Repository Controls

Cloudsmith provides comprehensive controls to allow you to secure, monitor and control the packages inside each repository.
