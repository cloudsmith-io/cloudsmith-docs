<Note variant="note" headline="Download Logs for Docker">
  Due to the nature of Docker and how layers may be shared across images, download counts for Docker are collected differently from other formats. The download count displayed for a Docker package is based on pulls of the "configuration" layer for an image, so pulls for other data-based layers aren't counted. However, this is typically enough to gauge usage for an image.
