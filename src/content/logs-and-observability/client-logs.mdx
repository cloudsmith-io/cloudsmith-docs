# Client Logs

Cloudsmith's Client Logs provide a single pane of glass to visualize, filter, and export information about package usage within your entire workspace. It keeps the same _artifact-agnostic_ support to unify information about all of your repositories, packages, and users in one place.

<BlockImage src={overview} alt="Client Logs Overview"></BlockImage>

<Note variant="note" headline="Disambiguation">
  If you want to learn how to review an audit of actions performed by users of your workspace, visit the [*Audit Logs*](/logs-and-observability/audit-logs) section.

  If you need information about usage to understand its impact in billing, click in the *Usage* tab in the top right corner of your Workspace.
</Note>

## Use cases

No matter if your goal is gaining visibility, performing an exploratory analysis, or reporting to stakeholders, Client Logs provides all the information that you need. Here you can find a few example use-cases:

- Analyze which Maven artifacts were downloaded last month.
- Understand all the different artifacts used in a staging pipeline. 

## Requirements

To access Client Logs, you should be a *Manager* or an *Owner* of your Workspace.

<Note variant="note" headline="Visibility">
Client Logs displays information about all of the repositories in a Workspace, no matter if they're public or private.
</Note>

## Navigating the Client Logs overview

You can access Client Logs directly from your Workspace Overview page or from any Repository main page.

To access your Client Logs, browse to any of your workspaces and click the *Logs* tab in the top right corner.
Executing the same action from a Repository Overview page takes you to the Client logs, but automatically adding a filter to include only download events associated with this repo.

The Client Logs area displays the following information:

<BlockImage src={overview_static} alt="Menus"></BlockImage>

| Section | Description |
| :--------------------- | :---------- |
| Filters | A Filter menu in the left to scope your search by any Target or Actor parameters. Learn more about fields available in [Fields and filters](#filters). |
| Time-graph | An interactive time-frame graph in the top of the screen to visualize how events distribute across the time-frame selected. Use this visualization to zoom into your data. |
| Log details | A list of events result from applying the filters to the search. Here you can visualize every single package downloaded from your workspace. You can review a detailed sample entry [here](/logs-and-observability/client-logs#analyzing-a-specific-entry). |
| Actions | Two action buttons in the top right corner to fetch new data or download a report of events with your selected scope. |

### Filters

Client Logs allow you to filter events by *time* or any of the download *fields available*.
There are two main categories:
- **Target**: Information about the artifacts or repositories.
- **Actor**: Identify who's downloading the package.

| Filter | Description | Filter | Description |
| :--------------------- | :---------- | :--------------------- | :---------- |
| **Target** || **Actor**  |
| Package Format | _Maven_, _Python_, _Docker_... you name it. Cloudsmith supports 30 different [formats](/formats). | IP Address | IP address of the download request | User Type | User or Service. |
| Repository Type | Public, Private, or OSS. | Users | Name, determined by the owner of the _API Token_ used. |
| Repository | the name of your repo. | Entitlement Token | Name of the service or non-human agent that downloaded the package. |

<Note variant="note" headline="About search limits">
  Some of these fields (for example, IP Address, Users and Entitlement Token) could potentially return many thousands of results in a dropdown. A 1k limit is applied, displaying the first 1k results ordered by descending most results.
</Note>

#### Using the time filters

The time graph shows how your package downloads distribute across time.
It helps you to visualize in a quick view when there's more or less demand.

<BlockImage src={timegraph_filter} alt="Filtering events in time"></BlockImage>

Each block in the graph represents the atomic time interval for the current view, for example one week. 
Hover your mouse over each of the block to preview the number of items downloaded in that period.

Use the left menu to select your desired time scope: _last 30 minutes_, _last hour_, _last day_, _last year_, or a _custom time range_ for more specific periods.

Alternatively, you can use the time graph to browse for a specific time range.
Click and drag your mouse in the graph to zoom in your data. to select the specific period you want to visualize.
This action displays the total number of items downloaded during the specified period.
Then, to apply the selected filter to the list of events, just click **Set as time range** and the web app returns a new filtered list of results.

Once applied the desired scope, you can preview the list of downloads matching the conditions.

## Visualizing events

When you perform a single download, the client may also need to fetch metadata about the package, indexes, and keys. 
As a result, a single package download usually results in more than one log. 
The number of requests that you see for a single download varies based on the package format.

For each of entries, you have an overview of the next information available:

| Column    | Description                                                                                                           |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event Type       | Cache Miss, Hit, etc.                                                                            |
| Timestamp        | The date and time of the request.                                     |
| Status Code      | The HTTP status code for the request.                                            |
| Target name      | The name of the asset requested                                       |
| Target EULA      | If requires acceptance of a End-User License Agreement (_EULA_). |
| File-size        | Size of the asset requested.                                     |
| Latency          | Response time.                                     |
| IP Address       | The IPv4 or IPv6 address for the request. |
| Authentication   | The type of authentication provided, if its a private repository.                             |


<Note variant="note" headline="About error logs">
  Client logs only contain successful requests, hence it is not a tool to expose error logs (for example, flagging that final users are fetching wrong packages or repos).
</Note>

## Analyzing a specific entry

Below you can find a preview of one of the event entries.

<BlockImage src={event_detail} alt="Filtering events in time"></BlockImage>

This log entry captures an event where the package `bartosz-testing` was requested. It is divided into several logical sections: **request**, **response**, **target**, and **actor**.

<Note variant="note" headline="Download Logs for Docker">
  Due to the nature of Docker and how layers may be shared across images, download counts for Docker are collected differently from other formats. The download count displayed for a Docker package is based on pulls of the "configuration" layer for an image, so pulls for other data-based layers aren't counted. However, this is typically enough to gauge usage for an image.

## Reporting

Once you have found what you were looking for, click in the top right corner download button and then confirm the **Download** to get a report of all the download actions in CSV format.

<Note variant="note" headline="Log entries limit">
  There is a limit of 500 log entries for download operations.

## FAQs and troubleshooting

### Why is the downloaded package name not populated?

There are two possible reasons:
- There wasn't a package download, it was a metadata file download.
- Deleted package since upload.

### Why is a repository/user/token field not populated?

Logs only contain anonymous identifiers for certain objects like packages, users, or repositories. So, if the field is empty, it's likely the repository/user/token has been deleted since the download occurred.
