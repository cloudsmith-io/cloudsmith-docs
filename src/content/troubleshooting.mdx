## Package fails to synchronize

Synchronization is where we extract the metadata and files within a package, process them and make the package available for download. There are a few reasons why a package may fail to complete this process: 

- Incomplete or malformed package metadata
- Corruption or errors in creating the package
- A temporary problem with back-end package processing

In some cases, especially with a temporary problem with package processing, synchronizing the package may resolve the issue. Please see [Package Resynchronization](/artifact-management/resync-a-package) for instructions. 

In the case of a corrupt package or missing/incomplete metadata, resynchronizing the package will not resolve the issue. You would need to fix the problem with the package itself and then re-upload the package again.
