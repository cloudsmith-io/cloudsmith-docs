# Introduction

The Cloudsmith REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) provides everything you love about Cloudsmith but in a programmatic machine-accessible RESTful format. We believe in providing a rich API to enable exciting and powerful integrations, hopefully in ways that we couldn't imagine - just like your favourite brick-like toys!
