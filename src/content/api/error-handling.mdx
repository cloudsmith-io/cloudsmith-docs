# Error Handling

Expected errors that occur when interacting with the API result in a `4xx` error code, which varies depending on the condition. All error responses contain at least a `detail` attribute explaining why the error occurred. The following is a list of some of the most common errors that are encountered and why:

## Not Authenticated

A `401 Unauthorized` status code is sent when the resource endpoint expects the user to be authenticated but the user isn't. For example, if sending a request as an anonymous user to an authenticated endpoint the following error is sent as a response:

```bash
HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
Allow: POST, OPTIONS
Content-Length: 58
Server: Cloudsmith MCP

{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

## No Permissions

A `403 Forbidden` status code is sent when the resource endpoint expects the user to have specific permissions, which will be detailed in the resource endpoint documentation. For example, if sending a request as an authenticated user to a resource endpoint in which we don't have permissions (such as one belonging to another user), the following error is sent as a response:

```bash
HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
Allow: POST, OPTIONS
Content-Length: 63
Server: Cloudsmith MCP

{
  "detail": "You do not have permission to perform this action."
}
```

> The `detail` field in response can be customised by the resource endpoint, so it might be different than the text shown above.

## Invalid JSON Object Error

A `400 Bad Request` status code is sent when the body of the document is expected to be JSON encoded, but the actual content is otherwise. For example, if the body was sent as `foo` then the following error is sent as a response:

```bash
HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request
Allow: POST, OPTIONS
Content-Length: 68
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Cloudsmith MCP

{
  "detail": "JSON parse error - No JSON object could be decoded"
}
```

## Malformed JSON Error

A `400 Bad Request` status code is sent when the body of the document is cannot be parsed as syntactically correct JSON. For example, if the body was sent as `{` then the following error is sent as a response:

```bash
HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request
Content-Length: 79
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Cloudsmith MCP

{
  "detail": "JSON parse error - Expecting object: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"
}
```

## Field Validation Error

A `422 Unprocess Entity` status code is sent when the resource endpoint receives a JSON body that is syntactically but not semantically correct. These error responses contain a `fields` attribute that lists the specific fields affected by the error condition. For example, if the resource endpoint expected a filename attribute in the  body to be populated but isn't then the following error is sent as a response:

```bash
HTTP/1.0 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Length: 132
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Cloudsmith MCP

{
  "fields": {
    "filename": [
      "This field may not be null."
    ]
  },
  "code": "invalid",
  "detail": "Invalid input."
}
```
