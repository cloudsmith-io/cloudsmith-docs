From within the Workspace profile settings, you have the ability to rename your organization's slug/identifier, and if you really need too, you can delete an organization (caution: this is a permanent action and cannot be undone). 

<Note variant="warning">
  If you rename the Workspace, then the URI that is used to connect to any repositories will change.  This change will affect any users that currently use the repositories as the URI would no longer be valid.
</Note>
