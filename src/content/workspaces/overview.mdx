# Workspace Overview

The "demo-docs" workspace overview provides a summary of package **usage** and **delivery**, with all the information required to understand and control all your repositories activity. It is organized into several key sections:

<BlockImage src={overview} alt=""></BlockImage>

### Header Navigation

A primary navigation bar at the top allows you to switch between different sections of the workspace:

- **Overview**: The current view, summarizing all activity.
- **Repositories**: View and manage all your repositories.
- **Packages**: Browse and manage all packages within your workspace. Use the search engine to narrow the view to your desired packages.
- **Accounts**: Manage user and service accounts and permissions.
- **Teams**: Organize users into teams.
- **Policies**: Define and manage EPM policies for your workspace.
- **Settings**: Configure workspace settings.

Secondary navigation includes:
- **Logs**: View client and audit logs for your workspace.
- **Usage**: access analytics and understand in more detail your package usage and delivery.
- **Compliance**: Get an overview of security findings and license violations.

### Workspace highlights

Under the top bar, 4 cards summarize information about:
- **Quarantined Packages**: The total number of packages that have been quarantined due to policy violations.
- **Vulnerable Packages**: The total count of packages with known vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Policy Violations**: The number of instances where packages do not comply with Workspace vulnerability policies.
- **License Policy Violations**: The number of packages that violate Workspace license policies.

### Workspace Analytics overview

The **Workspace** card provides a snapshot of the entities in the workspace:
- **Repositories**
- **Packages**
- **Container Images**
- **Accounts**

And also, the main area in your workspace overview page shows two different cards to help you understand in a quick glance the **package usage and delivery** of your users. This card details the data consumption for the workspace:
- **Artifact Data**: The total amount of storage used during the current month.
- **Package Delivery**: The total amount of bandwitch used during the current month.

This section also displays a graph visualizing the accumulated package delivery over the last month. It also provides a breakdown of usage and delivery by repository. 

To get a detailed view of package usage and delivery, browse to the Workspace Usage section.


### Recent Activity Lists

Two lists at the bottom of the page highlight the latest activities:

#### Recent Packages
This list shows the most recently added or updated packages in the workspace. Each entry includes:
- Package name and version.

#### Recent Repositories
