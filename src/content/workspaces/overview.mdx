- **Workspace Analytics Overview**: provides a high level view of usage and delivery analytics.
- **Recent activity**: stay on top of the latest activities within your workspace.

### Header Navigation

A primary navigation bar at the top allows you to switch between different sections of the workspace:

- **Overview**: The current view, summarizing all activity.
- **Repositories**: View and manage all your [repositories](/repositories).
- **Packages**: Browse and [manage all packages](/artifact-management/) within your workspace. Use the [search engine](/artifact-management/search-filter-sort-packages) to narrow the view to your desired packages.
- **Accounts**: Manage [user and service accounts](/accounts-and-teams/) and [permissions](/workspaces/privileges).
- **Teams**: Organize users into [teams](/accounts-and-teams/teams).

Secondary navigation includes:
- **Logs**: View [client and audit logs](/logs-and-observability) for your workspace.
- **Usage**: access [analytics](/logs-and-observability/client-statistics) and understand in more detail your package usage and delivery.
- **Security**: Get an overview of [security findings](/supply-chain-security) and [license violations](/supply-chain-security/license-compliance).

### Workspace Analytics overview

Under the top bar, 4 cards summarize information about:
- **Quarantined Packages**: The total number of packages that have been quarantined due to policy violations.
- **Vulnerable Packages**: The total count of packages with known vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Policy Violations**: The number of instances where packages do not comply with Workspace vulnerability policies.
- **License Policy Violations**: The number of packages that violate Workspace license policies.

The **Workspace** card provides a snapshot of the entities in the workspace:
- **Repositories**
- **Packages**
- **Container Images**
- **Accounts**

And also, the main area in your workspace overview page shows two different cards to help you understand in a quick glance the **package usage and delivery** of your users. This card details the data consumption for the workspace:
- **Artifact Data**: The total amount of storage used during the current month.
- **Package Delivery**: The total amount of bandwitch used during the current month.

This section also displays a graph visualizing the accumulated package delivery over the last month. It also provides a breakdown of usage and delivery by repository. 

To get a detailed view of package usage and delivery, browse to the Workspace Usage section.
