# Workspaces

Creating a Workspace in Cloudsmith allows you to configure access for teams, individuals and services that map to your company's structure. Building security and resilience in managing teams and workflows is essential in today's ecosystem.

<Note>
ðŸ“˜ We refer to your top-level account as **Workspaces**. Depending on the context, you might think of a Workspace as an **Organization**, a **Namespace**, or an **Owner**. These terms all refer to the same concept of a shared, top-level container for your work, but preferably **Workspace** will be used.

## Account Workspaces view

Click in the Cloudsmith Logo in the top left corner to see all the Workspaces that you can access with your account. Alternatively browse to: [https://app.cloudsmith.com/workspaces](https://app.cloudsmith.com/workspaces).

E-mail notifications will be sent after a new invitation. From this page you can also Accept or Reject new invitations. To learn how to invite users to a workspace, review the [Users](/accounts-and-teams/users) documentation.

## Primary Workspace

You can access multiple workspaces from a single account. This provides both isolation and flexibility for convenience of your Cloudsmith users. To find out what's your primary workspace, browse to your [workspace settings](https://app.cloudsmith.com/settings/workspaces).

<Note variant="warning" headline="SAML and SCIM">
A primary workspace defines the landing page when you login into Cloudsmith. This also have implications in terms of login with [SAML](/authentication/single-sign-on) and [SCIM](/authentication/scim) configuration, please refer to their documentation pages to learn more about how primary workspaces influence your login experience.

### Selecting or changing your Primary Workspace

From your Account Settings, click in Workspaces (or alternatively browse to [https://app.cloudsmith.com/settings/workspaces](https://app.cloudsmith.com/settings/workspaces)).

Here, you'll be presented with a list of all the Workspaces available for you. The star icon identifies your primary workspace.

## Workspace Overview Page

Browse to the [Workspace Overview Page](/workspaces/overview) documentation page to learn more about it.

## Workspace Settings

Browse to the [Workspace Settings](/workspaces/workspace-settings) documentation page to learn about the different controls available.

## Multiple Email Management

It's often the case that one ends up juggling multiple email accounts and using them simultaneously to access different services. This is often the case if you belong to multiple workspaces, and each provides you with an email address that is specific to it. To help manage and facilitate this, you can now add multiple email addresses to your Cloudsmith User Account. Once an email is verified, you can log in with it. You can also specify your primary email address, which we'll email when contacting you.

In addition to that, we're proud to say that we're fully compliant with the latest privacy laws in the EU (the GDPR, which you've likely heard about more often than you'd like to). As such, you can now manage your email communication preferences and choose whether you want to opt-in or opt-out for emails.
