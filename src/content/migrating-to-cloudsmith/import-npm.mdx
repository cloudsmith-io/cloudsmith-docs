# Import npm

Once you have exported all your npm packages you can upload them to Cloudsmith. 

First make sure you [install the Cloudsmith CLI ](/developer-tools/cli#installation) and export your token. 

A folder of npm packages, in the .tgz format, can be published to Cloudsmith using the script below.  
Create the bash script below and call it `migrate_npm_to_cs.sh` and give it execute privileges

```shell
#!/bin/bash
FILES="."
for f in "$2/"*.tgz
do
  echo "Processing $f file..."
  cloudsmith push npm "$1" $f
done
```

Execute the `migrate_npm_to_cs.sh` file passing the path of `<CLOUDSMITH_ORG>/<CLOUDSMITH_REPO>` and `<DIR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_NPM_PACKAGES>`

```shell
./migrate_npm_to_cs.sh cloudsmith_org/cloudsmith_repo <DIR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_NPM_PACKAGES>
```
