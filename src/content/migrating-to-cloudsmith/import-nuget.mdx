# Import NuGet

## Bulk Import of NuGet Packages using the Cloudsmith CLI

Once you have exported all your NuGet packages (.nupkg files) you can upload them to Cloudsmith- yay! 

First make sure you [install the Cloudsmith CLI ](/getting-started/cli#installation).

A folder of NuGet packages, in the .nupkg format, can be published to Cloudsmith using the scripts below in either powershell or bash

```powershell
# Script to upload all package in a directory into a Cloudsmith repo, using the Cloudsmith CLI

$SourceFolder = '/your/full/path/to/folder/conatining/nupkgs/here'
$TargetRepo = 'YOUR_CLOUDSMITH_ORG/YOUR_CLOUDSMITH_REPO'

Get-ChildItem -Path $SourceFolder -Filter '*.nupkg'|
    ForEach-Object {
        Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green "Pushing package "$_.Name""
        cloudsmith push nuget $TargetRepo $_.FullName
    }
```
```shell
#!/bin/bash
#Script to upload all package in a directory into a Cloudsmith repo, using the Cloudsmith CLI

# How to use:
# Save this bash script as 'migrate_nuget_to_cs.sh' and give it execute privileges
# this script tackes in 3 parameters from the command line:
# $1: '<YOUR_CLOUDSMITH_ORG>/<YOUR_CLOUDSMITH_REPO>' 
# $2: '</YOUR/FULL/PATH/TO/FOLDER/CONTAINING/NUPKGS/HERE>'
# $3: '<CLOUDSMITH_API_TOKEN>'
# To execute the script from the command line and pass in the 3 parameters: 
# ./migrate_nuget_to_cs.sh <YOUR_CLOUDSMITH_ORG>/<YOUR_CLOUDSMITH_REPO> </YOU/FULLl/PATH/TO/FOLDER/CONTAINING/NUPKGS/HERE> <CLOUDSMITH_API_TOKEN>
 
FILES="."
for f in "$2/"*.nupkg
do
  echo "Processing $f file..."
  cloudsmith push nuget "$1" $f -k $3
done
```
