# Import Files from a Folder

Once you have exported all your npm packages you can upload them to Cloudsmith- yay! 

First make sure you [install the Cloudsmith CLI ](/developer-tools/cli#installation) and export your token. 

A folder of packages in the correct format can be published to Cloudsmith using the script below. We support over 28+ format types. The supported formats can be found [here](/formats).

Create the bash script below and call it `migrate_npm_to_cs.sh` and give it execute privileges.  

Access the folder with your packages and run the next script:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
FILES="."

FILES=$(find . -type f)

for f in $FILES
do
  echo "Processing $f file..."
  cloudsmith push $2 "$1" "$f"
done
```

Execute the `migrate_npm_to_cs.sh` file passing the path of `<CLOUDSMITH_ORG>/<CLOUDSMITH_REPO>` and the [format type](/formats).

```shell
./migrate_npm_to_cs.sh cloudsmith_org/cloudsmith_repo python
```
