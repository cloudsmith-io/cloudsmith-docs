# Import RPM

Bulk import your RPM packages to Cloudsmith using a script. There are a few prerequisites that need to be set up prior to importing the packages in order for the script to work, and this can be changed to automate according to your setup.

**Setup**:

1. [Install the Cloudsmith CLI ](/developer-tools/cli#installation)
2. Create a folder to place the script and content into
3. Create a folder with exactly the same name as your repository name in Cloudsmith
4. Inside the created (repo) folder, create a distro folder you wish to upload, for a list of available distros, you can run `cloudsmith list distros rpm` and use the right side of the table as name for the folder. **PLEASE NOTE** that since the distro/release includes a slash, please create a folder replacing it with a dot (`.`). 

For example, if your distro is `el/any-version`, the folder should be named `el.any-version`. In full context: `<project_folder>/<repository_name>/<distro.release>`.

**Example folder structure**:

```text
rpm_import/
├─ config.ini
├─ credentials.ini
├─ rpm_import.sh
├─ repo_name_1/
│  ├─ any-distro.any-version/
│  │  ├─ some_package.rpm
├─ repo_name_2/
│  ├─ el.7/
│  │  ├─ some_package.rpm
```

5. Inside the folder insert all the `.rpm` files that will belong to that repository and distro/release. 

Finally, you can run the script below to start uploading files to the selected repository by running `sh rpm_import.sh`.

```shell rpm_import.sh
# Check if cloudsmith creds exist, if not run cloudsmith login
if [ ! -f config.ini ]; then
    echo "config.ini not found, running cloudsmith login"
    cloudsmith login
fi

# set org name and repo
read -p "Enter the repo name: " repo_name
read -p "Enter the organization name: " org_name

# get all folder names in repo_name and save to variable as release names
release_names=$(ls $repo_name)

# loop through release names and upload to cloudsmith
for release in $release_names; do
    # create a new veriable for release name and replace dot with slash
    release_name=$(echo $release | sed 's/\./\//g')
    
    # get all .rpm files in release and upload to cloudsmith
    for rpm in $(ls $repo_name/$release/*.rpm); do
        cloudsmith push rpm $org_name/$repo_name/$release_name $rpm --no-wait-for-sync
    done
done
```
