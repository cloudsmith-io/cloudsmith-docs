# Continuous security

Cloudsmith Security Scanning will automatically scan supported package types for CVEs upon upload of a package. You can also trigger subsequent scans manually via the Web UI, and via the Cloudsmith API. 

You can use the results of a Cloudsmith Security Scan to drive other actions such as to [quarantine a package](/artifact-management/package-quarantine), or as part of a package promotion workflow. 

Scan results are available via the [Web UI](/policy-management/security-scanning#scan-results-via-the-cloudsmith-web-ui), the [Cloudsmith API](/api/vulnerabilities/read) or even as a [Webhook](/logs-and-observability/webhooks).

If an advisory does not provide severity information, it falls back to NVD's CVSS scoring.

## Security Scan Results

The results of a security scan are available from the Cloudsmith Web UI, the Cloudsmith API and also via a Webhook. 

### Scan results via the Cloudsmith Web UI

You can find an overview of all the packages that have been scanned, or are awaiting an additional scan, via the "Compliance / Security" page in any repository: 

<BlockImage src={scans_repo_overview} alt=""></BlockImage>

The Security Scanning page shows a list of packages scanned, with information about:
- Maximum severity of vulnerabilities.
- Affected package.
- Number of vulnerabilities found.
- Time since last scan.

For more information and details, you can view the individual vulnerabilities found on the "Security" tab on any package detail page (alternatively, from the overview page click in the **Vulnerabilities Found** card): 

<BlockImage src={package_vulns} alt=""></BlockImage>

### Scan results via the Cloudsmith API

You can use the Cloudsmith [Vulnerabilities API endpoints](/api/vulnerabilities/namespace/list) to return the scan results for an entire organization account, a specific repository, an individual package or just a single scan id. 

### Scan results via Webhook.

Please see our [Webhooks](/logs-and-observability/webhooks) documentation for details of how to create a webhook and the full range of package events that are supported. 

## Performing additional security scans

You can perform additional security scans after the scan that is performed when the package is uploaded using the Cloudsmith UI or API. 

### Additional security scans via the Cloudsmith Web UI

{/* You can select one or more packages that you wish to security scan in the packages list in any repository:

<BlockImage src={imgb5651a5_Screenshot_2022_09_01_at_14_02_51} alt=""></BlockImage> */}

You can request an additional scan for an individual package from the package details page: 

<BlockImage src={additional_scan} alt=""></BlockImage>

### Additional security scans via the Cloudsmith API

You can request an additional security scan for a package using the [packages_scan API endpoint](/api/packages/scan).

### Early Access: Recurring security scans

You can now also set up security scans to occur on a recurring basis. This feature is currently in Early Access. To set up recurring security scans for your workspace, contact us to be added to Early Access.
