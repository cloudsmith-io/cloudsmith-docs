# Package signing

Cloudsmith uses GPG or RSA signatures (where applicable) in addition to package checksums to detect tampering. 

We calculate a signature for every file that is uploaded, but only some of the package formats make it available or use it. Only some of the formats also offer metadata signing.

For increased trust, you can also provide your own [GPG key](/repositories/repository-settings#custom-gpg-signing-key) or [RSA key](/repositories/repository-settings#custom-rsa-signing-key) for signing.
