# Software supply chain security

Modern software delivery pipelines face growing complexity and increasingly sophisticated supply chain attacks. Artifact management is the natural place to defend against these threats: every package and dependency passes through your registry, making it the control point for security. 

Cloudsmith delivers both the **control plane** (defining and enforcing policies) and the **data plane** (continuously scanning and acting on artifacts). Our **continuous security** engine keeps vulnerability and package quality data up to date in near real time, automatically applying your policies as artifacts move through the pipeline.

Cloudsmith helps you secure your software supply chain by enabling you to:

- **Block until scan**: Stop unverified packages from being downloaded until a security scan is complete, creating a dependency firewall across your organization.  
- **Vulnerability management**: Automatically identify and quarantine packages with known vulnerabilities before they enter your supply chain, reducing risk.  
- **License compliance**: Detect and track the licenses of your dependencies to avoid conflicts with organizational policy.  
- **Digital signatures**: Protect against tampering by verifying the integrity and authenticity of artifacts with GPG, PGP, and other signing standards.  

### Enterprise Policy Management (EPM)

- **Policy-as-Code (Early Access)**: EPM brings together the control plane and the data plane, letting you use all the data Cloudsmith knows about a package - metadata, vulnerabilities, licenses, provenance, and more - to define your policies as code. Create a single, version-controlled source of truth for managing supply chain security at scale. While existing features remain supported, policy as code is designed to become the primary method for policy management going forward.
