# Malware detection

Malware (*short for malicious software*) refers to any software or code intentionally designed to harm, disrupt, steal data, or compromise a system. It includes:

- Viruses
- Trojans
- Ransomware
- Spyware
- Backdoors
- Keyloggers

Malware can be delivered through many vectors—infected email attachments, malicious websites, compromised USB drives, or even software packages.

## Why shift malware detection left into artifact management systems

Integrating malware detection into an artifact management system helps stop threats at the source, reducing response time, and maintaining a clean, trusted repository of software components—before they ever touch your codebase or production systems.

Defense in depth is a strategy that employs multiple layers of protection to safeguard an organization's assets. Cloudsmith provides several barriers to protect against risky artifacts, including:
