# Continuous Security

Cloudsmith's continuous Security is one of the key components of Enterprise Policy Management (EPM), guaranteeing that the information about Software vulnerabilities and other advisories in your artifacts are up to date.

Attackers move fast, often exploiting a newly-disclosed vulnerability within hours. If your security scan only runs once every few days, youâ€™re leaving a wide-open gap for a breach. This window of exposure is the critical period where you are vulnerable and don't even know it. In modern software, where a single flaw in a small, shared library can compromise everything, you can't afford that delay. A near real-time feed of new vulnerabilities closes that gap. It means you can find out about a threat almost as soon as it's known, giving you the chance to quarantine a risky package or apply a patch before it can be used against you.

This documentation page aims at clarifying the distinction between Continuous Security and other vulnerability scanning methods, such as on-demand and scheduled scans.

## Evolving Security Scanning

To provide an almost real-time experience to deliver security feedback, Cloudsmith's scanning features have evolved. We offer both traditional scanning methods for deep, point-in-time analysis and a modern, continuous approach for immediate awareness of new threats.

### **On-Demand & Scheduled Scans _(Classic Vulnerability Scanning)_**

These scans perform a comprehensive, deep-dive analysis of a package to produce a complete vulnerability report. Because they analyze the entire package from scratch, they are perfect for an initial audit or for generating a definitive report at a specific point in time.
- **On-Demand**: A manual scan you can trigger at any time.
- **Scheduled**: An automated scan that runs on a recurring cadence.

### **Continuous Security**

This is the evolution of vulnerability management, designed to close the critical time gap that periodic scans leave open. Instead of re-scanning packages from scratch, Continuous Security instantly checks your packages against **new** vulnerability advisories as they are published. When a new threat is discovered that affects your software, this "always-on" process provides immediate feedback, alerting you to the risk without the delay of waiting for the next scheduled scan.

<Note>
ðŸ“˜ Both Continuous Security and traditional on-demand/scheduled scans currently use **Trivi** as their underlying vulnerability data source. Additionally, Continuous Security also enriches CVE information with a relevant [EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/data_stats) score.

## How Continuous Security Works

Continuous Security is enabled by default for all users using EPM. Its primary function is to check packages against a database of known vulnerabilities. This process is triggered in two main scenarios:

1. **When a new package is uploaded**: The package is checked against the current vulnerability database.
    - For Docker and OCI images, an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is generated first, and this SBOM is then used for the vulnerability check.
    - For other package types, Package URLs (PURLs) are used to match against advisories.
2. **When the vulnerability advisory database is updated**: Our system frequently pulls the latest vulnerability advisories (approximately every hour). When new advisories are added, existing packages are checked against this new information.

This frequent, near-constant checking ensures that vulnerability information for your packages is always current. Hence, those changes in the vulnerability data will trigger an EPM policy reevaluation, that might quarantine risky assets in case of a policy violation.

### The Role of Continuous Sercurity in EPM

The real power of Continuous Security is unlocked through **Enterprise Policy Management (EPM)**. The vulnerability data generated by Continuous Security is surfaced as an output that can be used to feed your EPM policies.

When a Continuous Security check finds a new vulnerability that matches the criteria of an EPM policy (e.g., a policy that quarantines any package with a CVSS score greater than 8), that policy will be triggered, and the corresponding action (quarantine) will be executed.

In essence, Continuous Security provides the real-time data feed, and EPM provides the automated action and enforcement based on that data that you can apply in all your Cloudsmith Workspaces.

{/* #### Continuous Security traces

At present, the direct output of Continuous Security is primarily visible through the **EPM Decision Log**. When a policy is triggered due to a new vulnerability discovered by Continuous Security, the Decision Log will show the evaluation and the resulting action.

It is important to note that the main package vulnerability list in the UI is populated by the traditional on-demand or scheduled scans, not by Continuous Security. Therefore, the EPM Decision Log is the most accurate place to see the impact of Continuous Security. */}
