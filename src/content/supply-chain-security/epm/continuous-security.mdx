# Continuous Security

Cloudsmith's continuous Security is one of the key components of Enterprise Policy Management (EPM), guaranteeing that the information about Software vulnerabilities and other advisories in your artifacts are up to date.

Attackers move fast, often exploiting a newly-disclosed vulnerability within hours. If your security scan only runs once every few days, youâ€™re leaving a wide-open gap for a breach. This window of exposure is the critical period where you are vulnerable and don't even know it. In modern software, where a single flaw in a small, shared library can compromise everything, you can't afford that delay. A near real-time feed of new vulnerabilities closes that gap. It means you can find out about a threat almost as soon as it's known, giving you the chance to quarantine a risky package or apply a patch before it can be used against you.

This documentation page aims at clarifying the distinction between Continuous Security and other vulnerability scanning methods, such as on-demand and scheduled scans.

## Understanding the Three Types of Security Scans

There are three primary types of security features available:

1. **On-Demand Scanning**: This is a manual scan that can be triggered at any time for a package. It is a computationally intensive operation that provides a detailed vulnerability analysis.

2. **Scheduled Scans**: These are essentially on-demand scans that are configured to run on a recurring schedule for a specific organization. They perform the same function as on-demand scans but on an automated cadence.

3. **Continuous Security**: This is an always-on process that provides a more immediate and efficient way of assessing vulnerabilities. Unlike on-demand or scheduled scans, Continuous Security does not require a full, heavy scan of a package each time. Instead, it leverages existing data and new vulnerability advisories to provide up-to-date security information.

<Note>
ðŸ“˜ Both Continuous Security and traditional on-demand/scheduled scans currently use **Trivi** as their underlying vulnerability data source. This means there is a high degree of parity between the vulnerability information available from both methods.

Within the EPM input metadata, you can access data from both:

- The `security_scan` object contains the results from a traditional on-demand or scheduled scan.
- The `vulnerabilities` object is populated by Continuous Security and includes additional information like EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) scores.
</Note>

## How Continuous Security Works

Continuous Security is enabled by default for all users using EPM. Its primary function is to check packages against a database of known vulnerabilities. This process is triggered in two main scenarios:

1. **When a new package is uploaded**: The package is checked against the current vulnerability database.
    - For Docker and OCI images, an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is generated first, and this SBOM is then used for the vulnerability check.
    - For other package types, Package URLs (PURLs) are used to match against advisories.
2. **When the vulnerability advisory database is updated**: Our system frequently pulls the latest vulnerability advisories (approximately every hour). When new advisories are added, existing packages are checked against this new information.

This frequent, near-constant checking ensures that vulnerability information for your packages is always current, without the need for repeated, resource-intensive full scans.

### The Role of Continuous Sercurity in EPM

The real power of Continuous Security is unlocked through **Enterprise Policy Management (EPM)**. The vulnerability data generated by Continuous Security is surfaced as an output that can be used to feed your EPM policies.

When a Continuous Security check finds a new vulnerability that matches the criteria of an EPM policy (e.g., a policy that quarantines any package with a CVSS score greater than 8), that policy will be triggered, and the corresponding action (quarantine) will be executed.

In essence, Continuous Security provides the real-time data feed, and EPM provides the automated action and enforcement based on that data that you can apply in all your Cloudsmith Workspaces.

#### Continuous Security traces

At present, the direct output of Continuous Security is primarily visible through the **EPM Decision Log**. When a policy is triggered due to a new vulnerability discovered by Continuous Security, the Decision Log will show the evaluation and the resulting action.

It is important to note that the main package vulnerability list in the UI is populated by the traditional on-demand or scheduled scans, not by Continuous Security. Therefore, the EPM Decision Log is the most accurate place to see the impact of Continuous Security.
