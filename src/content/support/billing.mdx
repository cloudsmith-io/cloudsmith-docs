# Billing

## Can I experiment with Cloudsmith as a developer?

Absolutely! The Core plan allows you to use the service at zero cost, with a modest allowance for artifact data and package delivery. You can upgrade to the Pro, Velocity, or Ultra plans if you need more generous allowances; these paid plans also allow you to pay by-the-gigabyte for on-demand usage that exceeds your allowances.

## Do you offer plans for Open Source repositories?

Yes, our Core plan includes support for open-source repositories. Just sign up and create open-source repositories. You don't need a special account for it. 

## Do you have a separate pricing package for each artifact type?

No - you can store and deliver any type of artifact format in a Cloudsmith repository, in any pricing plan.  Our pricing plans are differentiated by features and usage allowances.

## What happens if I use more than my allocation of artifact data and package delivery?

Cloudsmith offers a flat amount of built-in artifact data and package delivery per plan. For the paid plans, if you exceed these allocations, you'll be charged on-demand usage costs.

## How do I manage my usage costs?

You can restrict your usage limits in the settings dashboard for your user or organization. Artifact data and package delivery default to a limit of 200% of plan.

## I'm on the top tier but need more artifact data and package delivery; what can I do?

Impressive! If you require more artifact data and package delivery than our Ultra plan provides, then we can fit a custom plan (and pricing) around your needs. [Contact us](/contact-us) to get started!

## How do I get billed?

Aside from the free Core plan, you will be required to enter a credit card within the billing settings for your organization before selecting a paid plan.  Ultra plan customers can opt for annual billing via invoice.

## When do I get billed?

Immediately (or after any trial has finished), you will be automatically billed for the selected plan in addition to any on-demand costs accrued. From then on, you will be billed automatically every month, on the same day each month.

## Can I downgrade my active plan? What happens?

Yes, you can! You can downgrade at any time; once you do so, you'll be subject to the limits and on-demand costs of the lower plan. If by downgrading, you'll be causing your organization to exceed overage limits, then the downgrade may be prevented, but please be careful anyway. As for the plan cost, you'll be awarded a pro-rata balance equal to the difference between your current plan and the lower plan for the remaining billing period, but your billing period itself will remain the same.

## Can I upgrade my active plan tier? What happens?

Yes, you can! You can upgrade at any time, and you'll immediately benefit from the increased limits of the higher plan. As for the plan cost, you'll immediately be charged the pro-rata difference equal to the difference between your current plan and the higher plan for the remaining billing period, but your billing period itself will remain the same.

## How is the package delivery usage calculated?

Uploads (putting artifacts into Cloudsmith repositories) are free of charge, and do not count toward package delivery costs. Successful downloads, including partial downloads, contribute to your package delivery usage costs; we'll add the sent server/client bytes to your total usage. We don't charge by the number of requests; only outgoing bytes (downloads) are counted within a billing period. **Please Note** 1GB = 1,000,000,000 (1000^3) bytes, not 1,073,741,824 (1024^3) bytes. 

## How is the artifact data usage calculated?

Artifact data is calculated as a high watermark of your artifact data usage, i.e. the maximum amount of usage you've held at any  point within a single billing period. Think of this like a filling tank of water. For example, if you upload 500MB but then delete 250MB, your current usage will be 250MB, and your high watermark will  be 500MB. In this example, you'd be charged for 500MB of artifact data for the billing period; your next billing period will start with a high watermark of 250MB. **Please Note** 1GB = 1,000,000,000 (1000^3) Bytes, not 1,073,741,824 (1024^3) Bytes.

## I need a little more time to evaluate Cloudsmith - can you extend my trial period?

We are happy to discuss how we can make your evaluation more effective; please [contact us](/contact-us) with your request.  

## Can I cancel my account at any time?

Yes, but it'll make us sad! You can cancel at any time; cancellations take effect at the end of your current billing period. This means that you'll still have time to reactivate your account, and you'll be able to continue to use it until it expires. If you're thinking of leaving us, we'd really like to know why so we can either prevent it or make it better in the future! Please let us know.

## Do you have another question that isn't answered here?
