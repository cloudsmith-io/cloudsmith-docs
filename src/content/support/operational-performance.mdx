# Operational Performance

## Service Level Agreement

For customers on our Ultra plan, it's 99.9%, although our internal Service Level Objective is much higher, and our historic uptime is much closer to 99.99%. You can see our policy at:

## High Availability

Our uptime metrics (and incident/maintenance communications) are available via our [status page](https://status.cloudsmith.io) which publishes to [@iscloudsmithup](https://twitter.com/iscloudsmithup) twitter account.

## Geographic Infrastructure

Cloudsmith serves customers all over the world, across all continents. Our architecture is CDN-driven, and our non-CDN infrastructure is stood up in the following locations:

- Oregon, USA
- N. Virginia, USA
- Ohio, USA
- Dublin, Ireland (primary)
- Sydney, Australia

We provide eight geographic storage locations that you can choose from when creating a repository in the following locations:

- Dublin, Ireland
- Frankfurt, Germany
- Montreal, Canada
- Ohio, United States

## Maintenance Windows

When we need downtime, it's typically allocated for one hour but is usually much less than this (e.g. 15-30 minutes). We only allocate planned downtime for critical infrastructure changes (rare), and often only do so at weekends.

## Incident Management

Incidents are triaged and assigned a priority; if immediate action is required, these are fixed as a matter of urgency. We assess incidents in terms of exposure to customers and decide whether it needs to be communicated via our [status page](https://status.cloudsmith.io) if an immediate fix is required.

We fix bugs and issues as a matter of priority before features where possible.

As part of the **Priority Support** offered to **Ultra tier customers**, you can escalate urgent matters of importance to the on-call team at Cloudsmith. See [Support Escalation Policy](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/support-escalation-policy) for more details.
