# Operational Performance

## Service Level Agreement

For customers on our Ultra plan, it's 99.9%, although our internal Service Level Objective is much higher, and our historic uptime is much closer to 99.99%. You can see our policy at:

## Maintenance Windows

Cloudsmith operates a 24×7×365 global service designed for continuous availability, with no regularly scheduled downtime for updates.
We set aside a scheduled off-peak maintenance window on Saturdays from 22:00–23:00 UTC for critical infrastructure updates. Since the platform is architected for high availability and continuous deployment, this window is rarely used. 
We communicate any such maintenance 2 weeks in advance via our status page at https://status.cloudsmith.com. In exceptional circumstances only would there be a shorter notice period. 

## Incident Management

Incidents are triaged and assigned a priority; if immediate action is required, these are fixed as a matter of urgency. We assess incidents in terms of exposure to customers and decide whether it needs to be communicated via our [status page](https://status.cloudsmith.io) if an immediate fix is required.

We fix bugs and issues as a matter of priority before features where possible.

As part of the **Priority Support** offered to **Ultra tier customers**, you can escalate urgent matters of importance to the on-call team at Cloudsmith. See [Support Escalation Policy](/support/support-escalation-policy) for more details.
