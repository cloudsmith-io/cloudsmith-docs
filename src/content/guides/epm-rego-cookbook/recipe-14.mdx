# Recipe 14: Avoid Upload Packages With No Tags 

To complement the previous Tag Sprawl policy, you could create an additional EPM policy that flags packages with no tags at all, which is a useful approach to ensure all packages are categorised in some way.

<RemoteCodeBlock
  lang="rego"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudsmith-io/rego-recipes/refs/heads/main/recipe-14/policy.rego"
/>

**Trigger Condition:**  
count(pkg.tags) == 0

**When and How It's Triggered**  
When submitting raw packages to Cloudsmith, you'll notice that no tags are assigned if not specified in the package metadata or on upload via the CLI:

echo 'goodmorning' > goodmorning  
cloudsmith push raw acme-corporation/acme-repo-one goodmorning -k "$CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY"
