# Recipe 14: Block specific package and version

Alternatively, this policy will specifically block the Python package requests on the version 2.6.0:

<RemoteCodeBlock
  lang="rego"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudsmith-io/rego-recipes/refs/heads/main/recipe-14/policy.rego"
/>

## Trigger Condition 

```rego
target_name := "requests"  
target_versions := {"2.6.0"}
```

## When and How It's Triggered

Simply specify the exact package and package version mentioned in the deny-list style policy:

```bash
pip download requests==2.6.0  
cloudsmith push python WORKSPACE/REPO requests-2.6.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl \-k "API_KEY"
```

## Business value from this policy

Blocking specific package formats, filenames, or versions (even without a known CVE) is valuable because not all risks are tied to publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Some packages may be deprecated, unmaintained, or known internally to cause reliability issues, even if they haven't been formally reported as insecure. For example, an old library version might lack necessary features, be incompatible with your environment, or contain undocumented bugs that lead to downtime. In some cases, organizations also want to enforce licensing restrictions, avoid non-compliant dependencies, or prevent inclusion of internal/test builds that were never meant for production. By enforcing such rules proactively, you reduce the risk of operational failures, licensing problems, and accidental regressions before they impact your systems.

Additionally, the ability to block by format, filename, or version gives fine-grained control over your software supply chain. This is crucial in modern development pipelines where dozens of packages may be pulled from various sources automatically. Even if a package doesn't trigger a CVE scanner, it might be intentionally banned for business, legal, or quality reasons. Blocking at this level acts as a safety net, since it prevents accidental introduction of “bad” versions, enforces internal standards, and supports a defense-in-depth approach where security and stability aren't solely dependent on public vulnerability databases. This proactive control can catch issues before they escalate into incidents.
