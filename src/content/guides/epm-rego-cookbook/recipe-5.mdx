# Recipe 5: Time-Based CVSS Policy 

Evaluate vulnerabilities older than 30 days, check CVSS threshold ≥ 7, filter a specific repo, ignoring certain CVEs. This policy scopes to the testing-policy repository, ignores certain CVEs, requires CVSS ≥ 7 and only triggers if the vulnerability is older than 30 days.
