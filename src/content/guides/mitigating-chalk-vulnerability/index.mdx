# Policy Bulletin: Addressing Compromized JS Package Chalk 5.6.1

On September 8th 2025 we became aware of a [vulnerability in a widely-used JS library; Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk/issues/656#issuecomment-3266894253). We are advising Cloudsmith customers to create additional policies to block the affected package and related libraries.

<Note variant="note" headline="Classic Policies">
These policies are created as classic [Package Deny Policies](/policy-management/deny-policy), not [Enterprise Policy Manager](/supply-chain-security/epm).
