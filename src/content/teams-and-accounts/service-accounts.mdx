# Services Accounts

Services let you to create a Cloudsmith API Key not tied to a specific user. Services are ideal for any use case where you have automated processes (such as a CI/CD pipeline or similar) that requires write access to a repository. 

If your use case only requires pull or read access to a repository, use an [Entitlement Token](doc:entitlements).

  To create or manage Services for your organization, you need to have Owner or Manager permissions.
