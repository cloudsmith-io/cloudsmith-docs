# Accounts

Advanced account management that works for you.

## Manage Organizations
Give team members controlled access to your Cloudsmith account.

<ul>        
 <li><a href="/teams-and-accounts/teams">Teams</a></li>
 <li><a href="/teams-and-accounts/invite-users">Invite Users</a></li>
 <li><a href="/teams-and-accounts/email-management">Email Management</a></li>
 <li><a href="/teams-and-accounts/service-accounts">Service Accounts</a></li>     
 </ul>

## User security
Authentication options and permissions     
 <ul>
 <li><a href="/securing-your-workspace/single-sign-on">Single Sign-On</a></li>
 <li><a href="/securing-your-workspace/two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor Authentication</a></li>
 <li><a href="/securing-your-workspace/permissions">Permissions</a></li> 
 <li><a href="/getting-started/api-key">API Key</a></li>    
 </ul>

## Recommendations
We recommend you create an organization immediately; while all repositories and packages can be moved from a user account to a organization account; an organization account has the full features available to help manage your teams and users.
