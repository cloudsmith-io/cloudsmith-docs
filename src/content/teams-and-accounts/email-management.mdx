# Email Management

It's often the case that one ends up juggling multiple email accounts and using them simultaneously to access different services. This is often the case if you belong to multiple workspaces, and each provides you with an email address that is specific to it. To help manage and facilitate this, you can now add multiple email addresses to your Cloudsmith User Account. Once an email is verified, you can log in with it. You can also specify your primary email address, which we'll email when contacting you.

In addition to that, we're proud to say that we're fully compliant with the latest privacy laws in the EU (the GDPR, which you've likely heard about more often than you'd like to). As such, you can now manage your email communication preferences and choose whether you want to opt-in or opt-out for emails.
