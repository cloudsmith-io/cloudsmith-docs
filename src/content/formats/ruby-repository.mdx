# Ruby Repository

Cloudsmith provides public & private repositories for Ruby gems

<Video wistiaId="am8xpnnl2t"></Video>

Ruby Gems is the packaging format for Ruby language. Cloudsmith is proud to support fully-featured registries for managing your own private and public Gem packages.

For more information on Ruby, please see:

- [Ruby Lang](https://www.ruby-lang.org): The official website for Ruby language
- [Ruby Gem Community](https://rubygems.org): The official public repository for Ruby Gems
- [Ruby Gem Documentation](https://guides.rubygems.org): The official docs for Ruby Gems

<Note variant="note" headline="Contextual Documentation">
The examples in this document are generic. Cloudsmith provides contextual setup instructions within each repository, complete with copy and paste snippets (with your namespace/repo/rsa-key pre-configured).
</Note>

In the following examples: 

| Identifier      | Description                                                                               |

| PACKAGE_NAME    | The name of your package                                                                  |
| PACKAGE_VERSION | The version number of your package                                                        |

## Upload a Package

To upload, you need to generate your Ruby gem package first. You can do this with:

```shell
gem build PACKAGE_NAME.gemspec
```

This generates a gem package file (.gem) like `PACKAGE_NAME-PACKAGE_VERSION.gem` that you can upload.

<Note variant="note" headline="Note">
This assumes that you've created a `.gemspec` file for your project. Please see the official [Rubygems guide](https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/) on how to make your own gem for more information. (external link)
</Note>

### Upload via gem push

The endpoint for the native Ruby API is:

```
https://ruby.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

In order to authenticate for native publishing, you can either enter your credentials during the `gem push` command or add your credentials to your `$HOME/.gem/credentials` file:

```
:rubygems_api_key: API-KEY
```

You can also replace `:rubygems_api_key:` with an alternative, such as `:cloudsmith:`, and then specify `--key 'cloudsmith'` during the gem push command.

<Note variant="warning" headline="Warning">
These credentials are not encrypted. It is recommended to log in on the first `gem push` \`instead.
</Note>

To publish a gem, you can do so from your project directory using `gem push`:

```shell
gem push PACKAGE_NAME-VERSION.gem \
  --host 'https://ruby.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY'
```

If you haven't specified credentials above, you'll be asked for them during the push.

<Note variant="note" headline="Note">
You can also set the `RUBYGEMS_HOST` environment variable instead of `--host`:
</Note>

### Upload via the Cloudsmith CLI

For full details of how to install and setup the Cloudsmith CLI, see [Command Line Interface](/developer-tools/cli).

The command to upload a Ruby gem package via the Cloudsmith CLI is: 

```shell
cloudsmith push ruby OWNER/REPOSITORY PACKAGE_NAME-PACKAGE_VERSION.gem
```

Example: 

```shell
cloudsmith push ruby your-account/your-repo safe_yaml-1.0.4.gem
```

### Upload via Cloudsmith web app

Please see [Upload a Package](/artifact-management/package-upload) for details of how to upload via the Cloudsmith web app.

### Example Project

For examples of what your project should look like for packaging and publishing/uploading, please have a look at our [examples repository](http://github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-examples) (on GitHub). We'll supplement these with more detailed guidance later, but otherwise, just ask - we're here to help.

## Download / Install a Package

### Setup

As stated by [Bundler](https://bundler.io/), "Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed."

Bundler from version 1.7 supports scoped sources, so you can install a gem from Cloudsmith using the following declaration in your Gemfile:

#### Public Repositories

```shell
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE-NAME', '~> PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```

#### Private Repositories

<Note variant="note" headline="Private Repositories">
Private Cloudsmith repositories require authentication.  You can choose between two types of authentication, Entitlement Token Authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication. 
The setup method will differ depending on what authentication type you choose to use.
</Note>

<Note variant="warning" headline="Warning">
Entitlement Tokens, User Credentials and API-Keys should be treated as secrets, and you should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code, or expose them in any logs.
</Note>

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE-NAME', '~> PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
source 'https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE-NAME', '~> PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
source 'https://USERNAME:API-KEY@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE-NAME', '~> PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
source 'https://token:TOKEN@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE-NAME', '~> PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```

#### Setup with Ruby CLI

You can also add Cloudsmith as a source for the Ruby CLI instead:

#### Public Repositories

```shell
gem sources --add 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/'
```

#### Private Repositories

The Ruby CLI setup method will differ depending on what authentication type you choose to use.

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
gem sources --add 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/'
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
gem sources --add 'https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/'
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
gem sources --add 'https://USERNAME:API-KEY@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/'
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
gem sources --add 'https://token:TOKEN@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/'
```

### Specifying Dependencies

If you have a project **Gemfile** you can specify your Ruby gem package as a dependency:

#### Public Repositories

```shell
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE_NAME', 'PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```

#### Private Repositories

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE_NAME', 'PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
source 'https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE_NAME', 'PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
source 'https://USERNAME:API-KEY@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE_NAME', 'PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
source 'https://token:TOKEN@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ruby/' do
  gem 'PACKAGE_NAME', 'PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```

When specifying a private repository in a **Gemfile**, please bear in mind that the URL will contain the credentials (especially important if the **Gemfile** shared.)

Our recommendation is to specify the authentication credentials via environment variables, but you could also choose to encrypt your **Gemfile** via something like [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) (if you're using git or GitHub, for example).

### Installing a Package

Once setup, you can install your Ruby gem package using `gem install` as follows. 

To install a specific version of a package: 

```shell
 gem install 'PACKAGE_NAME:PACKAGE_VERSION'
```

To install the latest version of a package:

```shell
 gem install 'PACKAGE_NAME'
```
