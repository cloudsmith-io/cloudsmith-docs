# Terraform Modules Repository

Cloudsmith provides public & private repositories for Terraform Modules

<Video wistiaId="k7d0n349st"></Video>

Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool to provision and manage any cloud, infrastructure, or service by the awesome folks over at [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/). 

For more information on Terraform, please see:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): The official website for Terraform
- [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html): The official docs for Terraform

<Note variant="note" headline="Contextual Documentation">
The examples in this document are generic. Cloudsmith provides contextual setup instructions within each repository, complete with copy and paste snippets (with your namespace/repo/rsa-key pre-configured).

| MODULE_NAME     | The name of your Terraform Module                                                         |
| MODULE_VERSION  | The version number of your Terraform Module                                               |

## Upload a Module

### Upload via the Cloudsmith CLI or Website

To upload via the Cloudsmith API/CLI, you'll need to generate a module first. While we expect the tooling in this area to improve over time, currently the process is a manual one, and can be a little tricky.

You can build a package with standard command-line tooling like `tar.` To illustrate the process we'll use the [terraform vault module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault) for AWS as an example:

First, check out the version of the module we want to pack (0.13.6 for example purposes):

```shell
git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault.git
cd terraform-aws-vault
git checkout 0.13.6
```

Next, create an archive using: 

```shell
tar --exclude='.terraform' --exclude='*.tfstate*' --exclude='*_override.tf*' -czvf terraform-aws-vault-0.13.6.tar.gz .
```

<Note variant="note" headline="Note">
Only lowercase alphanumeric characters, underscores and hyphens are supported for the module name. Please see the official [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) for more information on building your own modules.
</Note>

#### Upload via Cloudsmith CLI

For full details of how to install and setup the Cloudsmith CLI, see [Command Line Interface](/getting-started/cli).

The command to upload a Terraform Module via the Cloudsmith CLI is: 

```shell
cloudsmith push terraform OWNER/REPOSITORY terraform-MODULE_PROVIDER-MODULE_NAME-MODULE_VERSION.tar.gz
```

Example:

```shell
cloudsmith push terraform demo/examples-repo terraform-aws-vault-0.13.6.tar.gz
```

#### Upload via Cloudsmith web app

Please see [Upload a Package](/artifact-management/package-upload) for details of how to upload via the Cloudsmith web app.

## Download / Install a Module

### Setup

Assuming you have Terraform already installed (if not, see the official docs), it is straightforward to add a Cloudsmith-based Terraform module.

First, the namespace, repository and credentials must be added to your `.terraformrc` or `terraform.rc` file. The token must contain the name of the organization which owns the module, the repository containing the module and the credentials required to authenticate with the API, delimited by a `/`:

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
credentials "terraform.cloudsmith.io" {
  token = "OWNER/REPOSITORY/TOKEN"
}
```
```shell API Key Auth
credentials "terraform.cloudsmith.io" {
  token = "OWNER/REPOSITORY/API-KEY"
}
```

<Note variant="warning" headline="Warning">
Entitlement Tokens, User Credentials and API-Keys should be treated as secrets, and you should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code or expose them in any logs.
</Note>

### Install a Module

Once configured as above, your module can then depend on a module from your registry by specifying the module's source in your Terraform file(s) using the syntax as outlined by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/modules/use.html#private-registry-module-sources):

```
module "my_module" {
  source = "terraform.cloudsmith.io/REPOSITORY/MODULE_NAME/local"
  version = "MODULE_VERSION"
}
```

Example:

```
module "my_module" {
  source = "terraform.cloudsmith.io/examples-repo/terraform-aws-vault-v0136targz/local"
  version = "v0.13.6"
}
```

Once added, terraform will download the module to your project's `.terraform` directory after running:

```shell
terraform init
```

You can install the latest version of this crate by removing the version variable from its declaration in your source code.

You can upgrade to the most recent version of this module matching your version constraints by running:

```shell
terraform init -upgrade=true
```
