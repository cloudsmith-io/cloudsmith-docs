# Generic Repository

Cloudsmith provides public & private repositories for Generic files

Cloudsmith supports Generic files, a flexible format for managing any file or binary that relies on specific file paths rather than semantic versioning.

<Note variant="note" headline="Contextual Documentation">
The examples in this document are generic. Cloudsmith provides contextual setup instructions within each repository, complete with copy and paste snippets (with your namespace/repo pre-configured).
</Note>

In the following examples:

| Identifier    | Description                                                                               |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OWNER         | Your Cloudsmith account name or organization name (namespace)                             |
| REPOSITORY    | Your Cloudsmith Repository name (also called "slug")                                      |
| TOKEN         | Your Cloudsmith Entitlement Token (see [Entitlements](/software-distribution/entitlement-tokens) for more details) |
| USERNAME      | Your Cloudsmith username                                                                  |
| PASSWORD      | Your Cloudsmith password                                                                  |
| API-KEY       | Your Cloudsmith API Key                                                                   |
| PATH_TO_FILE  | The local path to the file you want to upload (e.g., `~/downloads/file.tar.gz`)          |
| FILEPATH      | The repository path where the file will be stored (e.g., `path/to/file.tar.gz`)          |

## Why Generic Format?

The Generic format is designed for artifacts that rely on specific file paths rather than semantic versions. Key benefits include:

- **Path-Based Identification**: Uses the filepath as the unique identifier, enabling exact replication of upstream directory structures
- **Upstream Proxying and Caching**: Proxy and cache files from simple HTML-based upstream sources
- **Supply Chain Management**: Bring custom scripts, installers, and binaries into your managed supply chain
- **Consistent URLs**: Internal URLs remain consistent with upstream sources

### Generic vs Raw Format

The Generic format is optimized for path-based file distribution and upstream proxying. It does not support:
- Package versioning (semantic versions)
- End User License Agreements (EULA)

If you need semantic versioning or EULA support for your packages, use the [Raw format](/formats/raw-repository) instead. The Raw format provides traditional package management features including version tracking and license acceptance workflows.

## Upload a File

### Upload via the Cloudsmith CLI

For full details of how to install and setup the Cloudsmith CLI, see [Command Line Interface](/developer-tools/cli)

The command to upload via the Cloudsmith CLI is:

```shell
cloudsmith push generic OWNER/REPOSITORY PATH_TO_FILE --filepath FILEPATH
```

Example:

```shell
cloudsmith push generic your-account/your-repo ~/downloads/file.tar.gz --filepath distributions/latest/file.tar.gz
```

<Note variant="note" headline="Filepath parameter">
The `--filepath` parameter specifies where the file will be stored in the repository structure. This path becomes the unique identifier for the package and determines its download URL.
</Note>

### Upload via Cloudsmith web app

Please see [upload a package](/artifact-management/package-upload) for details of how to upload via the Cloudsmith web app.

## Download a Package

### Download via Cloudsmith web app

#### Public Repositories

When logged into Cloudsmith via a Web Browser, use the Download button located within the traffic light button dropdown on the package details page to download a generic package.

#### Private Repositories

For downloading from a private repository via the Cloudsmith web app, use the Use Package button to download a generic package using the default Entitlement Token for the repository. Use the dropdown arrow within the pop-up window to select a different authentication method.

### Download via Command Line

To download a Generic package, fetch uploaded files using a well-crafted URL. The package URL format is based on the filepath used when uploading.

#### Public Repositories

```text
https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/generic/FILEPATH
```

Example `curl` command to download a generic package from a public repository:

```shell
curl -sLf -O 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/generic/path/to/file.tar.gz'
```

#### Private Repositories

<Note variant="note" headline="Private Repositories">
Private Cloudsmith repositories require authentication. You can choose between Entitlement Token Authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication. The setup method will differ depending on what authentication type you choose to use.
</Note>

<Note variant="warning" headline="Secrets management">
Entitlement Tokens, User Credentials, and API-Keys should be treated as secrets. You should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code, or expose them in any logs.
</Note>

Using Entitlement Token authentication:

```shell
curl -sLf -O 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/generic/FILEPATH'
```

Using HTTP Basic authentication:

```shell
curl -sLf -u "USERNAME:PASSWORD" -O 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/generic/FILEPATH'
```

## HTML Indexes

Cloudsmith supports serving Apache-style HTML formatted indexes of generic package files in the repository. You can enable index generation in the [Repository Settings](/repositories/repository-settings).

When enabled, the HTML index is available at:

#### Public Repositories

```
https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/generic/
```

#### Private Repositories

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/generic/
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth
https://dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/generic/
```

## Upstream Proxying / Caching

<Tag variant="dark-green" theme="legacy">Supported</Tag>

<Note variant="note" headline="Early Access">
Generic upstreams are in Early Access. [Contact us](https://cloudsmith.com/company/contact-us) to enable it for your organization.
</Note>

The Generic format supports upstream proxying and caching for simple HTML-based sources. When a file is requested, Cloudsmith checks for a local copy. If missing, it fetches the file from the upstream, caches it as a first-class local package, and serves it.

### Configure an Upstream

To configure an upstream for your Generic repository, browse to your repository overview page and click the **Upstreams** tab. Then, click **+ Add Upstream Proxy** and choose the **Generic** format upstream.

In the upstream creation menu, define a name for your upstream and enter the upstream URL. You can optionally specify an **Upstream Prefix** to prevent file collisions when using multiple upstreams. Click **+ Create Upstream Proxy** and the upstream becomes immediately available.

<Note variant="note" headline="HTML-based upstreams">
Generic upstreams work with simple HTML-based sources. The upstream must consist of simple, unstyled HTML pages with no JavaScript. Each page should contain only links to package files or subdirectories. Examples include Gradle distributions, Apache releases, and Node distributions.
</Note>

Please see our [Upstream Proxying](/repositories/upstreams) documentation for further instructions on configuring upstreams.
