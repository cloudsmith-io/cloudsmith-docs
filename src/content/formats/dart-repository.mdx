<Video wistiaId="bueesq2jx3"></Video>

<Note variant="warning" headline="Dart SDK Versions">
From February 28th 2025, Cloudsmith will only support Dart SDK version `2.15.1` or greater. After this date support for SDK versions `<=2.14`, and associated workflows, will no longer be supported.
</Note>

Dart is a client-optimized programming language developed by Google.

## Upload a Package

## Publish via Dart

<Note variant="note" headline="Note">
Please note that Dart SDK >= 2.15 is required to use Dart Repositories.
</Note>

The endpoint for the native Dart API is:

```
https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

Your project `pubspec.yaml` defines the location that artifacts should be published to. Add the following to the root of this file:

```yaml
publish_to: https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

In order to authenticate for native publishing, you'll need run `dart pub token`, as follows:

```shell
echo 'API-KEY' | dart pub token add https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
Enter secret token:
Requests to "https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/" will now be authenticated using the secret token.
```

You can then publish from your project directory using `dart pub publish`:

```
dart pub publish
Uploading...
Upload complete. Package will available following synchronization.
```
<Note variant="note" headline="Limitation">
When publishing via the native API package sizes are limited to 200.0 MB per file. If this is an issue, please use the Cloudsmith CLI or API (which support up to 5GB for single-part uploads and beyond for multi-part), or contact us if that's not an option.
</Note>

### Upload via the Cloudsmith CLI

<Note variant="note" headline="Note">
Please see Dart's [documentation on creating packages](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/create-library-packages) for more information on building your own packages.
</Note>

#### Creating Dart Packages

To upload via the Cloudsmith API/CLI, you'll need to generate a package first.

You can build a package with standard command-line tooling like `tar`. To illustrate the process we'll use [cli_util](https://github.com/dart-lang/cli_util) as an example:

First, check out the version of cli_util we want to pack (**v0.1.3** for example purposes):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dart-lang/cli_util@v0.1.3
cd cli_util
```

```shell
tar --exclude='.dart_tool' -czvf cli_util_0.1.3.tar.gz ./*
```

For full details of how to install and setup the Cloudsmith CLI, see [Command Line Interface](/developer-tools/cli).

The command to upload a Dart package via the Cloudsmith CLI is: 

```shell
cloudsmith push dart OWNER/REPOSITORY PACKAGE_NAME-PACKAGE_VERSION.tgz
```

Example:

```shell
cloudsmith push dart org/repo your-package-1.0.0.tgz
```

### Upload via Cloudsmith Website

Please see [Upload a Package](/artifact-management/package-upload) for details of how to upload via the Cloudsmith web app.

## Download / Install a Package

**Public Repositories** 

No further setup is required with public repositories, you can add a dependency from this repository to your package `pubspec.yaml` automatically with `dart pub`. See [Installing a Package](/formats/dart-repository)

**Private Repositories**

In order to authenticate, you need to run `dart pub token`, as follows:

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
echo 'TOKEN' | dart pub token add https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
Enter secret token:
Requests to "https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/" will now be authenticated using the secret token.
```
```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
echo 'PASSWORD' | dart pub token add https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
Enter secret token:
Requests to "https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/" will now be authenticated using the secret token.
```
```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
echo 'API-KEY' | dart pub token add https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
Enter secret token:
Requests to "https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/" will now be authenticated using the secret token.
```
```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
echo 'TOKEN' | dart pub token add https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
Enter secret token:
Requests to "https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/" will now be authenticated using the secret token.
```

## Installing a package

`dart pub` is capable of adding a dependency from this repository to your package `pubspec.yaml` automatically:

**Public Or Private Repositories**

```shell
dart pub add PACKAGE_NAME:PACKAGE_VERSION --hosted-url https://dart.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
Resolving dependencies...
+ your-package 1.2.3
Downloading your-package 1.2.3...
Changed 1 dependency!
```

Please also see the [pubspec docs](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec) for further examples of pubspec files.

## Security Scanning
