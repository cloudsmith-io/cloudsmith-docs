# Python Repository

Cloudsmith provides public & private repositories for Python packages

<Video wistiaId="nh8mkpjak7"></Video>

Python is an awesome general-purpose programming language. Cloudsmith is proud to support fully-featured registries for managing your own public and private python packages.

For more information on Python, please see:

- [Python](https://python.org): The official website for Python
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org): The Python Package Index

<Note variant="note" headline="Contextual Documentation">
The examples in this document are generic. Cloudsmith provides contextual setup instructions within each repository, complete with copy and paste snippets (with your namespace/repo/rsa-key pre-configured).
</Note>

In the following examples: 

| Identifier      | Description                                                                               |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OWNER           | Your Cloudsmith account name or organization name (namespace)                             |
| REPOSITORY      | Your Cloudsmith Repository name (also called "slug")                                      |
| TOKEN           | Your Cloudsmith Entitlement Token (see [Entitlements](/software-distribution/entitlement-tokens) for more details) |
| USERNAME        | Your Cloudsmith username                                                                  |
| PASSWORD        | Your Cloudsmith password                                                                  |
| API-KEY         | Your Cloudsmith API Key                                                                   |
| PACKAGE_NAME    | The name of your package                                                                  |
| PACKAGE_VERSION | The version number of your package                                                        |


<Note variant="note" headline="UV Support">
The main examples in this docs use `pip` or the Cloudsmith CLI. If you use [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and wants to learn how to integrate it with Cloudsmith, jump to the [UV Support section](#uv-support).
</Note>

## Upload a Package

To upload, you need to generate your package first. You can do this with:

```shell
python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
```

This generates a wheel package file (`.whl`) like `your-package-1.2.3.whl` that you can upload.

<Note variant="note" headline="setup.py required">
This assumes that you've created a `setup.py` file for your project. Please see the [official PyPi](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-setup-py) packaging guide on how to create a `setup.py` for more information. There are also different types of distributions that you might be interested in, such as a source distribution, tarball distribution, etc.
</Note>

### Upload via native Python tooling

The endpoint for the native Python API is:

```
https://python.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

In order to authenticate for native publishing, you'll need to create a `.pypirc` file (in your `$HOME` or project directory), with the following:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers =
  pypi
  cloudsmith
[cloudsmith]
  repository: https://python.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  username: USERNAME
  password: API-KEY
```

You can then publish from your project directory using [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/):

```shell
twine upload -r cloudsmith dist/PACKAGE_NAME-PACKAGE_VERSION.whl
```

### Upload via the Cloudsmith CLI

For full details of how to install and setup the Cloudsmith CLI, see [Command Line Interface](/developer-tools/cli).

The command to upload a Python package via the Cloudsmith CLI is: 

```shell
cloudsmith push python OWNER/REPOSITORY PACKAGE_NAME-PACKAGE_VERSION.whl
```

Example: 

```shell
cloudsmith push python org/repo boto3-1.4.4.py2.p3-none-any.whl
```

### Upload via Cloudsmith web app

Please see [Upload a Package](/artifact-management/package-upload#upload-via-website-ui) for details of how to upload via the Cloudsmith web app.

## Download / Install a package

### Setup

You have a choice of 2 methods to set up your Cloudsmith repository: 

- Python set up via command line
- Python set up via Pip

#### Public Repositories

##### Set up via command line

Tell pip the location of your Cloudsmith repository using the the `--index-url` option.

```shell
pip install PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION --index-url https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
```

##### Set up via Pip

Similar to set up via command-line, pip needs to be passed the `--index-url` configuration option. To do this add `--index-url` to the top of your `requirements.txt` (or similar) file:

```
--index-url https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION
```

#### Private Repositories
<Note variant="note" headline="Private Repositories">
Private Cloudsmith repositories require authentication.  You can choose between two types of authentication, Entitlement Token Authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication. 
The setup method will differ depending on what authentication type you choose to use.
</Note>

<Note variant="warning" headline="Warning">
Entitlement Tokens, User Credentials and API-Keys should be treated as secrets, and you should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code, or expose them in any logs.
</Note>

##### Set up via command line

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
pip install PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION --index-url https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
pip install PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION --index-url https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
pip install PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION --index-url https://USERNAME:API-KEY@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
```
```shell HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
pip install PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION --index-url https://token:TOKEN@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
```

##### Set up via Pip

Similar to set up via command-line, pip needs to be passed the `--index-url` configuration option. To do this add `--index-url` to the top of your `requirements.txt` (or similar) file:

```text Entitlement Token Auth
--index-url https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION
```
```text HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
--index-url https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION
```
```text HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
--index-url https://USERNAME:API-KEY@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION
```
```text HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
--index-url https://token:TOKEN@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/
PACKAGE_NAME==PACKAGE_VERSION
```

<Note variant="tip">
_**Private Repository Credential Security**_

As private repositories require authentication in order to access the repository content, when specifying a private repository in a `requirements.txt` file please bear in mind that the URL will contain the credentials (especially important if the `requirements.txt` file is shared.)

You could choose to encrypt your `requirements.txt` file via something like [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) (if you're using git or GitHub, for example).
</Note>

### Removing Setup

If you no longer want to install packages from the repository, remove the `--index-url` line from your `$HOME/.pip/pip.conf file`.

### Extra index url

When using pip to access your packages, there are two parameter options to ensure pip searches your repository - they are [`--index-url`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_wheel/?highlight=--index-url#cmdoption-i) and [`--extra-index-url`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_wheel/?highlight=--index-url#cmdoption-extra-index-url).

There is an important distinction to be made between these parameters, especially from a security perspective.

Specifying `--index-url` will override pip's default repository and _only_ search the specified repository. This is the recommended approach from Cloudsmith. This improves your security posture as it reduces the risk of malicious public packages being installed in place of your own.

<Note variant="warning" headline="Dependency confusion">
An attack known as [dependency confusion](https://cloudsmith.com/blog/dependency-confusion-attacks): where an attacker can claim the package on the public repository in a way that will ensure it gets chosen over the private package.
</Note>

If you still wish to access third-party repositories, like `pypi.org`, paid-for Cloudsmith plans include upstream proxying. This allows your repository to call out to other python repositories whenever a package cannot be found in your repository. See the Upstream Proxying section below.

If your Cloudsmith plan does not include upstream proxying and some of your dependencies live outside your Cloudsmith repository, then you can also also specify extra index urls to pip. This is done by specifying `--extra-index-url`.  When pip is supplied with extra index urls, it has a _list_ of repositories it searches for packages (the extra urls plus the index url). Note, _this list is not ordered_. All repositories are considered equal and pip will simply search for the _best_ package match according to [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). Using the `--extra-index-url` increases your exposure to dependency confusion attacks.

See [pip install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#pip-install) for more information.

<Note variant="note" headline="Indexing external repositories">
To search your Cloudsmith repository for packages use the `--index-url` Pip configuration argument. Using the `--index-url` configuration option will force pip to search only the Cloudsmith repository and will result in pip not being able to install public (PyPi) packages that your private package may depend on. This reduces your exposure to dependency confusion attacks.
</Note>

## UV Support

`uv` is quickly gaining traction as a Python package and project manager. It stands out for its ultra-fast dependency resolution, native lock-file support (which enables reproducible builds, as we'll discuss later), and a built-in publisher.

In the following sections, you'll learn how to install and publish your Python packages with uv in your private Cloudsmith repositories.

### Project setup

#### Requirements

In case you don't have it yet, use `pip` to install `uv` and `build`.
```bash
pip install uv --upgrade
uv pip install build
```

#### Create project assets

Let's start defining a new `pyproject.toml` file for your project. Replace `OWNER`, `REPOSITORY` with your own Cloudsmith Workspace and Repository names:

```toml
[project]
name            = "sample-flask-app"
version         = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies    = [
  "requests==2.32.3"
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "cloudsmith"
url  = "https://dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/python/simple/"
# optional, but recommended for publish:
publish-url = "https://python.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/"
```

Then, define the next environmental variables for `uv` to perform basic HTTP Auth. Replace `API-KEY` with your user API Token:

```bash
# install / resolution
export UV_INDEX_CLOUDSMITH_USERNAME=token       # literal string
export UV_INDEX_CLOUDSMITH_PASSWORD=API-KEY

# optional: forbid fallback to PyPI
export UV_PIP_NO_INDEX=1

# publishing
export UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME=token
export UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD=<API-KEY>
```

`uv` will use them to authenticate against your Cloudsmith repository.
Now, execute the next command to fetch and install all the required dependencies in your active virtual environment:

```bash
# create a venv first:
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate 
# install dependencies
uv pip install --system -r pyproject.toml
```

You'll find information about the dependencies being fetched:

<BlockImage src={uv_terminal} alt=""></BlockImage>

This will result in all required packages being fetched directly from your Cloudsmith repository (please note that an upstream needs to be configured).

<BlockImage src={uv_dependencies} alt=""></BlockImage>

Once installed, just run the next command to build your wheel package and the source distribution (.tar.gz) file, including your Python "source code" and everything required to run it:

```bash
python -m build && ls dist/
```

Once those assets are ready, just publish both artifacts to Cloudsmith. Remember to specify your `cloudsmith` index as defined in the `[[tool.uv.index.name]]` field in your project definition:

```bash
uv publish --index cloudsmith dist/*
```

Browse to your Cloudsmith repository to find your new application packages.

<Note variant="note" headline="Integration with other CI/CD tooling">
This example explain how to run it in your local machine, but instructions can be adjusted to run this process within any of the existing CI/CD tooling you might use: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, TeamCity, etc. In this case, the only requirement is that the `uv` environmental variables are exported first, so you can push your artifacts into the private Cloudsmith repository. You can find a sample [GH Action workflow](https://github.com/ciaracarey/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial/blob/644b230e14bea3763b4c7b4a3f6500c1f664ee25/.github/workflows/python-app.yml) reproducing a similar workflow.
</Note>

### Reproducible builds via `uv compile`

A software compiling process is reproducible when it ensures that it will always output the same binary.

`uv compile` allows you to lock the exact versions so the environment can be reproduced in later builds. Without locking, the versions of dependencies could change over time, when using a different tool, or across platforms.

For example, to freeze the dependencies of the previous `pyproject.toml` project and generate a deterministic lock‑file, execute:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
```

This will generate a `requirements.lock` file like the following:

```
Resolved 5 packages in 581ms
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
certifi==2025.6.15
    # via requests
charset-normalizer==3.4.2
    # via requests
idna==3.10
    # via requests
requests==2.32.3
    # via sample-flask-app (pyproject.toml)
urllib3==2.5.0
    # via requests
```

This file specifies the version for each of the packages used and the its source. Adding the `uv` dependency freezing capabilities to Cloudsmith Upstreams caching will allow you to guarantee that the software you distribute remain stable and reproducible.

Once you have the file, you just need to use it to install your project and guarantee all remains unchanged:

```bash
uv pip install --system --strict -r requirements.lock
```

## Upstream Proxying / Caching

<Tag variant="dark-green" theme="legacy">Configurable Proxying</Tag><Tag variant="orange" theme="legacy">Caching</Tag>

Please see [Upstream Proxying](/repositories/upstreams) for more details.

Upstreams provide a way to _blend_ multiple Python repositories into a single repository. This allows your single Cloudsmith repository to serve packages from multiple 'upstream' repositories (like PyPi.org, Artifactory, DevPi etc). Please note, blended upstreams can be a source of dependency confusion attacks.
