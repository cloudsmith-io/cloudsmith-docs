# Cloudsmith configuration

## SAML authentication

Under the `SAML Authentication` setup in your Cloudsmith organization settings, you will need to configure `SAML Metadata URL` and `SAML Metadata XML`. The values for these can be found in your Cloudsmith application in PingIdentity.

Under the `Applications` heading in the left hand menu of PingIdentity, choose "Applications" and then click on your application, then select the Configuration tab.

Copy the `IDP Metadata URL` and paste that into the `SAML Metadata URL` field in the SAML authentication configuration page of Cloudsmith.

Click the `Download Metadata` button to download an XML file containing details of the application. Save this file somewhere and open it up in a text editor (or other application like Firefox that will allow you to copy the text within). Copy all of the text and paste that into the `SAML Metadata XML` field in Cloudsmith. Ensure the `Enable SAML Authentication (and Signup)` checkbox is ticked and save the configuration.

## SAML Group Sync

Under the `SAML Group Sync` setup in your Cloudsmith organization settings, click on the `Create Group Sync Mapping` button. You will need to provide the `Attribute Key`, `Attribute value` and the team that this configuration will act against.

The `Attribute Key` will be what was mapped for the `Group IDs` attribute in your applications attribute mappings within PingIdentity. In the example above, this is `groups`, but can be found by navigating to your application and checking the `Attribute mappings` tab.

The `Attribute value` will be the `Group ID` of the group within PingIdentity. This can be found by navigating to your group and checking the `Overview` tab.

Once this is configured, select the Role within Cloudsmith that this will apply to (either Member or Manager) and click save. The next time a user logs in to Cloudsmith and is attached to this group within PingIdentity, they should be automatically provisioned for the selected teams within Cloudsmith.
