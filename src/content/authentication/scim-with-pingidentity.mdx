# SCIM with Ping Identity

SCIM, or **System for Cross-domain Identity Management**, is an open standard designed to manage user identity information. Cloudsmith is SCIM 2.0-compliant. With Cloudsmith's support for SCIM, you can automatically provision new users, de-provision existing users, and update existing users' profile information based on changes within your Identity Provider (IdP).

To begin using SCIM, you need to enable the SCIM functionality in the [Cloudsmith Workspace Settings](/workspaces/workspace-settings).

## Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Cloudsmith Workspace Settings.
2. Navigate to **Authentication → SCIM** and enable the SCIM functionality by selecting **"Allow SCIM."**
