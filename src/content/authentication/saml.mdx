Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard that allows Identity Providers (IdP), such as Okta, to pass authorization credentials to Service Providers (SP), such as Cloudsmith. Basically, your users can authenticate using a Single Sign-On (SSO) source that you control, which is more secure.
