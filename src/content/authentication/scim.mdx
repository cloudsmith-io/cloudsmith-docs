# SCIM

## Overview

SCIM, or System for Cross-domain Identity Management, is an open standard designed to manage user identity information. Cloudsmith is SCIM 2.0-compliant. With Cloudsmith's support for SCIM, you can automatically provision new users, de-provision existing users and update existing users profile information based on changes within your Identity Provider (IdP).

<Note>
ðŸ“˜ To provision users via SCIM, you need to setup the workspace as the primary workspace. Users from other workspaces cannot be managed via SCIM.
If you have any question, reach out to [support](https://cloudsmith.com/company/contact-us).
