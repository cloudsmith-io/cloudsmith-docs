# SCIM

## Overview

SCIM, or **System for Cross‑domain Identity Management**, is an open standard designed to manage user identity information. Cloudsmith is SCIM 2.0‑compliant. With Cloudsmith’s support for SCIM, you can automatically provision new users, de‑provision existing users and update user profile information based on changes within your IdP.
