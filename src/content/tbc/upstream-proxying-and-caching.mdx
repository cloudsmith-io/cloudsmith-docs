# Upstream Proxying and Caching

Upstream proxying and caching allows you to upload and use the packages you own, while Cloudsmith fetches and caches other packages (such as dependencies). 

This enables you to use Cloudsmith as a first-class cache and a central source of truth for packages, to protect you from outages of external services (which is especially important when running behind your firewall).

## Upstream Concepts

Cloudsmith upstream support centers around several key concepts:

- _Proxying_: The act of transparently allowing access to a package that exists on an upstream repository. Package managers see the remote package as one which belongs to the Cloudsmith repository.
- _Caching_: An extension to the proxying functionality, where requested packages from an upstream are fetched and permanently stored in your Cloudsmith repository. This helps to ensure package dependencies are always available and helps to protect from upstream outages or security breaches.
- _Indexing_: In order to be aware of the packages available from an upstream, Cloudsmith builds an index. This process occurs when an upstream is first added to your Cloudsmith repository and is scheduled for a resync on a regular basis.

### Indexing

Index availability is a critical factor for upstream handling on Cloudsmith, helping to ensure deterministic performance for upstream requests and a deeper insight into the availability of packages.

The indexing process can differ, depending on the package format and upstream itself. Where possible, Cloudsmith will determine the availability of all packages on an upstream repository _ahead-of-time_, which generally means that an upstream repository is unavailable when first added, until this indexing process has occurred.

For package formats that do not maintain a centralized mechanism for retrieval of all packages, Cloudsmith employs a _just-in-time_ indexing mechanism. In this approach, awareness of packages is made the first time a package is successfully cached from an upstream repository. Going forwards, Cloudsmith maintains a list of all versions available on the source upstream for the package and ensures this is kept in sync.

When neither indexing mechanism is available for an upstream, Cloudsmith falls back to a _real-time_ unindexed approach. When requests are made for upstream packages, Cloudsmith determines availability across each upstream in your repository, in real-time. This is the least performant approach.

We strive to ensure that at least _just-in-time_ indexing is available for each package format and upstream source, although this is not always possible.

### Priority

When defining upstreams for a repository, a _priority_ can be specified. The priority of an upstream is used to determine the order in which upstream requests are resolved. Cloudsmith evaluates upstreams by the order of `1..n`.

A good approach when determining what priority to apply to upstreams is to ensure that the lowest value is specified for the upstream which is most likely to contain upstream packages you request. This helps to improve performance in the event that an upstream source does not support any of our indexing mechanisms.

| Name                      | A descriptive name for this upstream source. A shortened version of this name will be used for tagging cached packages retrieved from this upstream.                                             |
| Priority                  | The weighting of the Upstream source. Upstream sources are selected for resolving requests by sequential order (1..n), followed by creation date.                                                |
| Upstream URL              | The URL for this upstream source. This must be a fully qualified URL including any path elements required to reach the root of the repository.                                                   |
| Proxy Only                | Proxy requests through to upstream sources in order to match assets that are not present in this repository.                                                                                     |
| Cache and Proxy           | Proxy the initial request for an asset through to the upstream source and then store (cache) resolved assets in this repository for future requests.                                             |
| Verify SSL Certificates   | If enabled, SSL certificates are verified when requests are made to this upstream. We recommended leaving this enabled for all public sources to help mitigate Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. |
| Authentication (optional) | Optional credentials that can be provided if the upstream is not publicly accessible                                                                                                             |
| Headers (optional)        | Optional Key-Value headers that can be passed to upstreams with each request.                                                                                                                    |
