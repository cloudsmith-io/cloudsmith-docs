# Dependency Firewall

The Cloudsmith Dependency Firewall is a configurable isolation layer that controls what happens to packages downloaded from upstream sources such as npm, Maven Central, etc.

It consists of a set of features that allow you to exercise and implement controls over what packages can be consumed by developers and build processes. 

The Cloudsmith Dependency Firewall is composed of the following features: 

- [Upstream proxy and caching](doc:upstream-proxying-caching)
- [Vulnerability Scanning and Policies](/supply-chain-security/vulnerability-policy)
- [License Scanning and Policies](/supply-chain-security/license-policy)
- [Package Deny Rules](/supply-chain-security/deny-policy)
- [Package Quarantine](doc:package-quarantine)

See [here](/supply-chain-security/policy-management) for more information on how Policy Management works.
