# SCIM

## Overview

SCIM, or System for Cross-domain Identity Management, is an open standard designed to manage user identity information. Cloudsmith is SCIM 2.0-compliant. With Cloudsmith's support for SCIM, you can automatically provision new users, de-provision existing users and update existing users profile information based on changes within your Identity Provider (IdP).

## Supported Providers
