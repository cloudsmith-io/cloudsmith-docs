# Integrating GCP CloudBuild

Cloudsmith can be used as a target for all the assets created using Google CloudBuild. This guide shows you how to use the Cloudsmith CLI to upload/push a Python package to your Cloudsmith repo.

All formats are supported.

## Getting Started

Integrating Cloudsmith as part of your Google CloudBuild project is as simple as [installing the Cloudsmith CLI](/developer-tools/cli) during your build and then using the `cloudsmith push` command to upload the artifacts from your build process to your Cloudsmith repository.

### Adding your API Key to Google Cloud

In order to use the Cloudsmith CLI with Google CloudBuild, we recommend you to create a **Cloudsmith [service account](/accounts-and-teams/service-account)** and use its API key instead of a personal API key. This is more secure, easier to audit, and better suited for CI/CD environments like Google CloudBuild.

Once youâ€™ve created a service account and generated its API key, we recommend that you add the key as an environment variable using **Google Secret Manager**. 

<Note>
ðŸ“˜ Authentication best practices

We do not recommend adding the API-Key itself directly into the `cloudbuild.yaml` file for your Google CloudBuild project, as it will then be revealed in any resulting logs from the build.
</Note>

### Step 1: Store the API key in Google Secret Manager

1. Go to the Secret Manager page in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Click **+ CREATE SECRET**.
3. In the **Name** field, enter `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY`.
4. In the **Secret value** field, paste your Cloudsmith service account API key.
5. Leave other settings as default or configure as needed.
6. Click **CREATE SECRET**.

### Step 2: Grant Cloud Build access to the secret

Your Cloud Build service account (usually `[PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`) needs permission to access the secret.

1. Go to the Secret Manager page.
2. Click on the **CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY** secret.
3. Go to the **PERMISSIONS** tab.
4. Click **+ GRANT ACCESS**.
5. In **New principals**, enter your Cloud Build service account.
6. Under **Select a role**, choose Secret Manager Secret Accessor.
7. Click **SAVE**.

### Step 3: Reference the secret in cloudbuild.yaml

To reference a secret stored in Google Secrets Manager in your Google CloudBuild `cloudbuild.yaml` file you would use the following syntax: 

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'python'
    secretEnv: ['CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY']
```

For further details on using Google Secrets Manager with Google CloudBuild see [Use secrets from Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/securing-builds/use-secrets).

### Adding the Cloudsmith CLI to your CloudBuild Project

To add the Cloudsmith CLI to your Google CloudBuild Project, add the following command to the `cloudbuild.yaml` file: 

```yaml
    - pip install cloudsmith-cli
```

### Uploading a built artifact to Cloudsmith

To upload an artifact from a build to a Cloudsmith repository, add the `cloudsmith push` command in `cloudbuild.yaml` file: 

```yaml
    - cloudsmith push FORMAT OWNER/REPOSITORY FILENAME
```

Please see the [Cloudsmith CLI](/developer-tools/cli) documentation for more details of the syntax of the `cloudsmith push` command and the [Supported Formats](/formats) page for examples of the `cloudsmith push` command for each supported format.

## Example cloudbuild.yaml

Hereâ€™s a complete working example that builds a Python package and uploads it to a Cloudsmith repository:

```yaml
steps:

  - name: 'python'
    entrypoint: bash
    secretEnv: ['CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY']
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        echo "Setting up virtualenv and installing Cloudsmith CLI..."
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel cloudsmith-cli

        echo "Building package..."
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

        echo "Authenticating with Cloudsmith..."
        cloudsmith whoami 

        echo "Pushing package to Cloudsmith..."
        cloudsmith push python ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME dist/*.whl

availableSecrets:
  secretManager:
    - versionName: projects/your-gcp-project-id/secrets/CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY/versions/latest
      env: CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY
```

<Note>
ðŸ“˜ Replace `your-org/your-repo` with your actual Cloudsmith organization/repository name.

Also update `your-gcp-project-id` with your actual Google Cloud project ID.
