[Datadog](<https://www.datadoghq.com/>) is an observability service for cloud-scale apps, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. At Cloudsmith, we're big fans of Datadog and use it to monitor and visualize how our system is performing across a range of services and tools.

The Datadog Cloudsmith Integration is a simple and effective visualization tool for your workspace artifact usage, package delivery, audit logs, and all of the security and compliance details of your assets. This integration also helps you monitor [consumption and usage](https://cloudsmith.com/blog/track-your-bandwidth-storage-limits-with-our-quota-api) within Cloudsmith, along with all of the audit logs and security scanning information we provide to help you spot if any suspicious activity is going on in your workspace.

## Metrics available

The Datadog Cloudsmith integration tracks the following metrics organized in four main areas:

- Artifact data and package delivery
- Token Visibility
- Workspace members
- Events and Security

Below you can find more information of each of them with some samples of how they look like.

### Artifact data and package delivery

Monitor percentage usage and raw values (in bytes or gigabytes) for both artifact data (_storage_) and package delivery (_bandwidth_). Usage equal to 75% and 85% trigger a critical alerts, based on your plan limits.

| Metric Name                                     | Metric Type | Description                                                                                                                     |

## Install the Cloudsmith Datadog Integration

The Cloudsmith Datadog Integration is a Datadog [Community Integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/use-community-integrations/?tab=agentv721v621). Follow these steps to install and configure it.


### Requirements: Datadog Agent

First things first, you need to install the Datadog Agent.

The Datadog agent is software that runs on your hosts. It collects events and metrics from hosts and sends them to Datadog, where you can analyze your monitoring and performance data. To install the Datadog agent, follow the steps [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/).


### Cloudsmith Datadog Integration Installation

The Cloudsmith check is a [Community Integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/use-community-integrations/?tab=agentv721v621) and isn't included in the [Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/login?next=%2Faccount%2Fsettings#agent) package, so you need to install it.

For Agent versions `v7.21+ / v6.21+`, follow the instructions below to install the Cloudsmith check on your host. Run the following command to install the Cloudsmith Agent integration:

```bash
datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-cloudsmith==1.0.0
```

<Note>📘 Visit the Datadog [integration page](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloudsmith/) to find the latest version</Note>


### Configuration

Once installed, configure your integration similar to core integrations. There are 3 configuration values:

| Config Name        | Config Description                                                                         |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`                | The Cloudsmith API URL (https://api.cloudsmith.io) |
| `cloudsmith_api_key` | Your Cloudsmith API key                                                                    |
| `organization`       | The Cloudsmith [Workspace](/workspaces) (Workspace) that you are monitoring     |
| `min_collection_interval`    | Collection interval of the check. **We recommend to set it's value to 180**. |

Follow these steps to configure your Cloudsmith Datadog Integration:

1. Edit the `cloudsmith.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Cloudsmith performance data. See the [sample](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/blob/master/cloudsmith/datadog_checks/cloudsmith/data/conf.yaml.example) **_cloudsmith.d/conf.yaml_** for all available configuration options.
2. [Restart the Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/agent-commands/?tab=agentv6v7#start-stop-and-restart-the-agent).

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/agent-commands/?tab=agentv6v7#agent-status-and-information) and look for `cloudsmith` under the Checks section.

### Activate the Cloudsmith Integration in Datadog 

Log into [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) and from the side bar select **_Integrations->integrations_** and select the Cloudsmith integration.

<BlockImage src={addIntegration} alt="" align="left"></BlockImage>

Open the Configuration tab and select **_Install Integration_**.

<BlockImage src={config} alt="" align="left"></BlockImage>

After these steps, you are ready to start using this integration.

## Visualizing your Cloudsmith data in Datadog

Datadog dashboards enable you to efficiently monitor your infrastructure and integrations by displaying and tracking key metrics. Once the Agent is installed with the Cloudsmith check, you can use the metrics in any Datadog dashboard.

The Cloudsmith Datadog Integration comes with its own dashboard allowing you to monitor your Cloudsmith workspaces out of the box.

1. From Datadog, select **_Dashboards->Dashboard_** list to view your dashboards.
2. Select your installed Cloudsmith dashboard, listed as **_Cloudsmith Overview_**.

<BlockImage src={findDashboard} alt="" align="left"></BlockImage>

Once completed, you can created a custom Dashboard or just use the default dashboard as displayed in the image below.

<BlockImage src={dataDogCSDashboardImage} alt="" align="left"></BlockImage>

<Note>📘 Each widget in the dashboard reflects real-time data from the Cloudsmith API and is grouped by functional area — ensuring clear operational visibility for your teams.</Note>

## To sum it up

The Datadog Cloudsmith Integration is a simple and effective visualization tool for monitoring your token, artifact data, package delivery, audit logs, and vulnerability scanning. Manage and forecast your monthly usage. If you identify a limit that's approaching a threshold, then you can quickly and easily adjust your [limits](/workspaces/workspace-settings#usage-limits) at any time within the Cloudsmith UI.

If you already use Datadog to monitor your tools and services, this tool is for you.
