# Integrating with Chainguard Images

[Chainguard](chainguard.dev), a Docker Verified Publisher, offers Chainguard Images which are a collection of minimal, hardened Docker container images featuring:

- Zero CVEs
- Includes SBOMs and signatures
- Minimal, containing only the application and its runtime dependencies

You can retrieve these images through Cloudsmith by enabling the upstream to Chainguard.

Chainguard offers both a Public Registry (cgr.dev/chainguard) containing developer images and a Private/Dedicated Registry (cgr.dev/chainguard-private) which includes all versioned tags of an image and special images not available in the public registry (including FIPS images and other custom builds).

## Adding Chainguard as an Upstream

Here's how you can integrate the Chainguard Registry into your Cloudsmith account:

1. **Configure Upstream Proxying**  
   In your Cloudsmith repository, go to the Upstream Proxying settings.  
   Click the green "Create Upstream" button and select the Docker format.  
   Provide a descriptive name for the upstream, e.g., Chainguard Public, and specify the URL for the Chainguard Registry.  
   Enter the Chainguard Registry URL:
   - For Chainguard’s public images: https://cgr.dev
   - For Chainguard’s Private/Dedicated Registry: https://cgr.dev/chainguard-private
     Set the desired priority.  
     Select Cache and Proxy.
2. **Configure SSL Certificate Verification**  
   Ensure SSL certificates are verified for added security, especially for public sources.
3. **Authentication and Headers**  
   If you are using the private URL, Chainguard requires authentication or additional headers; provide them in the respective fields.

## Pull a Chainguard Image with Docker Native Tooling

Here’s an example of how you would pull the nginx Chainguard Docker image into Cloudsmith after you’ve configured your Cloudsmith upstream for Chainguard:

1. **Configure your Cloudsmith upstream** for Chainguard using the instructions above.
2. **Ensure Docker is installed** on your system. If not, go [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to get started with Docker.
3. **Open a terminal.**
4. **Login to Docker** with your Cloudsmith username and token, with the command: docker login docker.cloudsmith.io
5. **Pull the latest Chainguard nginx image** by running:  
   docker pull docker.cloudsmith.io/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY/chainguard/nginx:latest  
   Note: Replace ORGANIZATION and REPOSITORY with your Cloudsmith organization and repository, respectively.
6. **Check your Cloudsmith repository** to find the newly added Chainguard nginx image.
