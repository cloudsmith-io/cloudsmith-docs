# Integrations

import { Note } from '@/components';

At Cloudsmith, our goal is to make it as easy as possible to get your packages into our system from where you can manage and distribute them according to your need.


Cloudsmith comes with an awesome [CLI](/getting-started/cli) (Command Line Interface) tool, a discoverable first-class [API](https://api.cloudsmith.io), and [bindings](getting-started/api-bindings) allowing you to publish and download your packages and containers using practically any leading DevOps tool/service.

<Note variant="note" headline="Service Accounts">
For CI/CD, we would usually recommend that you create a Service Account in your organization. See [Service Accounts](/accounts-and-teams/service-accounts) for more details.
