# Integrating with Drone CI

Drone is a Continuous Integration platform that allows automation of build, test, and release workflows using a powerful, cloud-native pipeline engine.

## API Key Configuration

You need to add your Cloudsmith [API Key](https://cloudsmith.io/user/settings/api/) within Drone CI. We recommend storing your Cloudsmith API Key as a [per-repository or per-organization secret](https://docs.drone.io/secret/) in the Drone Server and then injecting the `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY` environment variable into your build jobs like: 

```yaml
environment:
CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY:
    from_secret: CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY
```

## Examples

In the following examples:

| Identifier   | Description                                                   |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OWNER        | Your Cloudsmith account name or organisation name (namespace) |
| REPOSITORY   | Your Cloudsmith Repository name (also called "slug")          |
| FORMAT       | The format of the package, i.e "deb", "maven", "npm" etc      |
| PACKAGE_FILE | The filename of the package                                   |

### Build Step Example

To push an artifact from a build step, you just need to add the commands to install the Cloudsmith CLI and use the `cloudsmith push` command: 

```yaml
steps:
  - pip install cloudsmith-cli 
  - cloudsmith push FORMAT OWNER/REPOSITORY/PACKAGE_FILE
```

### Docker Pipeline Example

Drone supports different types of [pipelines](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/overview/), each optimized for different use cases and runtime environments.   

For example, you can use a Docker pipeline with your own Docker image that includes the Cloudsmith CLI, negating the need to install the CLI in a Build Step.  The following example configuration specifies a Docker image from a Cloudsmith repository:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Build and Push Package
  image: docker.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/IMAGE_NAME:latest
  environment:
    CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY:
      from_secret: CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY
  commands:
    - .......
    - .......
    - cloudsmith push FORMAT OWNER/REPOSITORY/PACKAGE_FILENAME
image_pull_secrets:
 - dockerconfigjson
```

As the Docker image used for the pipeline in this example is hosted in a private Cloudsmith repository, you need to authenticate to the repository to pull the image for use. You can add the authentication credentials as a [per-repository or per-organization secret](https://docs.drone.io/secret/) in Drone CI. You can obtain these credentials from your `~/.docker/.config.json` file after you do a normal `docker login` to your Cloudsmith repository

You then use `image_pull_secrets`, with the name of the secrets file you created in Drone CI to enable your pipeline to authenticate to your Cloudsmith repository.
<Note variant="note">
The push command will vary with the package format, an example of the push command for a debian package would look like: `cloudsmith push deb my-org/my-repo/ubuntu/xenial foo-1.0.deb`. Please see the [Cloudsmith CLI](/getting-started/cli) for full details of the push command for other formats and additional help.
