Searching for packages is simple and powerful with Cloudsmith. The search syntax is fully "boolean", in that you can combine queries together with `AND` (i.e. find this AND that), or `OR` (i.e. find this OR that), or `NOT` (i.e. find NOT this). This is optional, if you don't put any boolean operators (AND/OR) in, we'll just assume that you want `AND` by default.

**For all queries you can use:**  
`~` for negation.  (Example: `~foo`)

**For string queries you can use:**  
`^`   - to anchor to start of term.  (Example: `^foo`)  
`$` -  to anchor to end of term.  (Example: `foo$`)  
`*`  -  for fuzzy matching.  (Example: `foo*bar`)

**For number or date queries you can use:**  
`>`   -  for values greater than.  (Example: `>foo`)  
`>=` -  for values greater / equal.  (Example: `>=foo`)  
`<`   -  for values less than.  (Example: `<foo`)  
`<=` -  for values less / equal.  (Example: `<=foo`)

Please note, when you use a query like `uploaded: >'1 month ago'`, that becomes `uploaded > dd/mm/yy` (i.e, within the last month).

**For version queries you can use:**  
`>`   -  for versions greater than.  (Example: `>1.2.3.`)  
`>=` -  for versions greater / equal.  (Example: `>=1.2.3`)  
`<`   -  for versions less than.  (Example: `<1.2.3`)  
`<=` -  for versions less / equal.  (Example: `<=1.2.3`)  
`~=` -  for versions greater than or equal to, upto the next incompatible version. (Example: `~=1.2.0`)

> ðŸ“˜ Remember: You can use any combination of `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`. You can use parentheses to group terms if required, as `AND` has a higher precedence than `OR`, and it may change the meaning of queries without it.

## A Short Working Example

Suppose that you had the following packages:

- AlphaLib, Version: 1.0
- AlphaLib, Version: 1.1
- AlphaLib, Version: 2.0
- BetaLib: Version: 0.9

To find "AlphaLib" packages that are in the version 1.x series only, your query would be:  
`name:^AlphaLib$ AND version:~=1.0.`

Which would provide the following results:

- AlphaLib, Version: 1.0
- AlphaLib, Version: 1.1

To bring the query down, we added the following parts:

- `name:^AlphaLib$` - Find a package name that is **exactly** "AlphaLib". Without the `^` (starts-with) and `$` (ends-with), the query would be fuzzy, and potentially find packages called "AlphaLib2" or "FreeAlphaLib" too.
- `AND` - We want to search for both the name and version together. Both must match for the results.
- `version:~=1.0` - Find package versions that are at-least 1.0, upto the next incompatible version (2.0).

## Searching Packages via the Website UI

At the top of every page is the search box:

        "https://files.readme.io/97075343a9a33ef4bbc6957a18556c5b6cdd8e7b22ef88370bdd70f23d3e2902-package-search-6-edited.png",
        "",
        "Search box in the Website UI"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Search box in the Website UI"
    }
  ]

Additional help and examples are available by hovering over the "? Search syntax" at the right side of the search box.

## Searching Packages via the Cloudsmith API

Please see the Cloudsmith API [interactive sandbox](https://api-prd.cloudsmith.io/v1/#!/packages/packages_list) and the full API [reference](https://help.cloudsmith.io/reference#packages_list).

## Searching Packages via the Cloudsmith CLI

To search packages using the Cloudsmith CLI, you use the `cloudsmith list packages` command in combination with the `-q` option: 

```shell
cloudsmith list packages OWNER/REPOSITORY -q "SEARCH_TERMS"
```

**Example**  
To search for all debian packages: 

```shell
cloudsmith list packages cloudsmith/examples -q "format:deb"
```

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/1aa0913-search_pkgs_cli_format.png",
        "search_pkgs_cli_format.png",
        1120
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "CLI search for format \"deb\""
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**Example**  
To search for the latest rpm and composer packages: 

```shell
cloudsmith list packages cloudsmith/examples -q "tag:latest AND (format:rpm OR format:composer)"
```

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a2f0d45-search_pkgs_cli_tag_and.png",
        "search_pkgs_cli_tag_and.png",
        1223
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "CLI search for tag \"latest\" and two formats"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


**Example**  
To search for all python packages larger than 2KB with more than 50 downloads: 

```shell
cloudsmith list packages cloudsmith/examples -q "format:python AND downloads:>50 AND size:>2048"
```

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ac51e3f-search_pkgs_cli_size_dls.png",
        "search_pkgs_cli_size_dls.png",
        1117
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "CLI search for python packages larger than 2KB with more than 50 downloads"
    }
