# Recycle Bin

Temporary storage for deleted artifacts

The repository recycle bin allows you to store deleted artifacts pending permanent deletion. 

You can also restore artifacts to the repository from the Recycle Bin. This can be useful in cases of accidental artifact deletion or when evaluating/configuring [Artifact Lifecycle](/artifact-management/retention-lifecycle) rules.    

<Note variant="note" headline="Early Access Feature">
The Recycle Bin is currently an early access feature. If you would like to try this feature, please [Contact Us](/contact-us).
</Note>

<Note variant="warning" headline="Artifact Retention">
Artifacts in the recycle bin are retained for a 2 week period and then are automatically deleted.
</Note>
