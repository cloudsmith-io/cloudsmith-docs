# Delete a Package

We provide two ways to remove your packages/files/assets from your repositories: 

- Delete via the API using tools/integrations (such as the Cloudsmith CLI), 
- Delete directly via the Website UI.


## Delete via Cloudsmith CLI

### Identify a Package

To delete a package using the Cloudsmith CLI, you first need to identify the package you wish to delete.  See [Package Identification](/artifact-management/identifying-a-package) for instructions to do this. 

### Delete a Package

Once you have identified the package, you use the `cloudsmith delete` command to delete it: 

```shell
cloudsmith delete OWNER/REPO/UNIQUE_ID
```

For example: 

```shell
cloudsmith delete demo/examples-repo/G0rDBWcVBMEm
```

In this example, we identified that the package we want to delete has the Unique ID "G0rDBWcVBMEm" and we are deleting it from the "my-example-repo" repository:

## Delete via Website UI

You can delete a package via the Website UI:

- Via the repository packages list
- Via the package detail page

### Delete via Repository Packages List

To delete a package via the repository packages list, click the dots to the right of the package name, then click "Delete":
<BlockImage src={imgbe49c4d7e893dc1b25fd782231f15ba60592560219f9cc28514a899e2f491f1c_delete_package_packages_list} alt="Delete package button on repository packages list"></BlockImage>

### Delete via the Package Detail page

To delete a package via the package detail page, click the "Delete" button to the right of the package name:

<BlockImage src={imgd6974a35e0c4fe829cbeb8abfb4488fa35515b9e4e1a2a3f256402634b5496b6_delete_packages_packages_detail} alt="Delete package button on package detail page"></BlockImage>

After clicking a "Delete" button, you will then be presented with a confirmation form. Click "Delete" again to confirm deletion of the package:

<BlockImage src={imgd921030cd95b8c1260d26b9fa23d7ca5cbd89d325d1b36a3cdaa2c66f9f25033_delete_package_confirmation} alt="Delete package form"></BlockImage>

You will then get an on-screen message confirming that the package has been deleted.
