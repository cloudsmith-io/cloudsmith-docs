# Retention Rules

Cloudsmith retention rules allow you to automatically manage storage for packages by deleting those packages you don't need any more.

Each repository has one retention rule, that you can configure with a set of parameters to define what to keep.
This means, those packages that fall outside of the defined retention rules will be deleted. The main parameters to define your rules are:
- the number of packages (count).
- the size of packages (bytes).
- the number of days (time).
- a search query to filter packages.

Jump to the [Configuration](#configuration) section to learn more about these fields.

## Triggers

Retention rules are applied when a new package is synchronized or re-synchronized in a repository.
Retention rules can also be triggered by resyncing the most recently uploaded package in your repository.

<Note variant="note">
Note that you could have one package at 1000 days, and the 90 days retention still wouldn't activate.
Only after uploading a new package would the 1000 day package be deleted.
</Note>

Cloudsmith determines which packages to delete by using a cutoff date.
The cutoff date is calculated by subtracting the retention days from the uploaded date of the resynced package.

For example: if your newest package was uploaded on June 10th and the retention period is 4 days, the cutoff date is June 6th. Any packages uploaded before June 6th are eligible for deletion.

<Note>📘 Although a re-sync process will re-evaluate retention rules, it won't alter the most recent upload date on a package.</Note>

## Enabling Retention Rules

Retention Rules for a repository are disabled by default. Go to your repository settings, and in the lefthand menu, click Retention Rules. Click on the "Enable" button in the yellow banner to enable them.
Alternatively, use the API to enable it with:

```shell
curl --request PATCH \
  --url 'https://api.cloudsmith.io/v1/repos/WORKSPACE/REPOSITORY/retention?=' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
  --form retention_enabled=true
```

## Configuration parameters

| Name | API | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Enabled?  | `retention_enabled`     | If checked, the retention lifecycle rules will be activated for the repository. Any packages that don't match will be deleted automatically, and the rest are retained.      |      
| Limit by days  | `retention_days_limit`     | The number of days of packages to retain. Set to zero to remove this criteria from the rules to apply.      |      
| Limit by count    | `retention_count_limit`     | The maximum number of packages to retain. Set to zero to remove this criteria from the rules to apply.     |      
| Limit by size    | `retention_size_limit`     | The maximum total size (in bytes) of packages to retain. Set to zero to remove this criteria from the rules to apply.     |      
| Group packages by Name |   `retention_group_by_name` | If checked, retention will apply to groups of packages by name rather than all packages. For example, when retaining by a limit of 1 and you upload PkgA 1.0, PkgB 1.0 and PkgB 1.1; only PkgB 1.0 is deleted because there are two (2) PkgBs and one (1) PkgA.        |
| Group packages by Format | `retention_group_by_format` | If checked, retention will apply to packages by package formats rather than across all package formats.For example, when retaining by a limit of 1 and you upload `PythonPkg 1.0` and `RubyPkg 1.0`, no packages are deleted because they are different formats.         |
| Group packages by Type |  `retention_group_by_package_type` | If checked, retention will apply to packages by package type (e.g. by binary, by source, etc.), rather than across all package types for one or more formats. For example, when retaining by a limit of 1 and you upload `DebPackage 1.0` and `DebSourcePackage 1.0`, no packages are deleted because they are different package types, binary and source respectively.         |    
| Query String   |  `retention_package_query_string` | A package search expression which, if provided, filters the packages to be deleted. For example, a search expression of `name:foo` will result in only packages called `foo` being deleted, or a search expression of `tag:~latest` will prevent any packages tagged `latest` from being deleted. Refer to the Cloudsmith documentation for package query syntax.  |         

<Note>📘 From the UI, use the sliders to set your rules, and finally click the green "Update" button to apply it.
Some fields not available in the UI, use the API instead.</Note>

### Configuration parameters via API

Visit [API reference](https://api.cloudsmith.io/v1/swagger/) and search by `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/retention`.

As a reference, use `GET` to consult an existing a retention rule in your `{owner}/{repo}` repository  or `PATCH` when you need to update it.

## Other considerations

The retention rules are disjunctive, so it uses all three to select what to delete.
In other words, if a package meets any of the criteria `(condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3)` or none, it will be kept.
But, if a package meets all of the criteria `(condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3)`, it will be deleted.

### Limiting the number of packages to delete
The **Limit by count** option defines the number of packages to keep. For example, if we set its value to `4` and only a total of `3` packages meet the criteria, then `0` packages will be deleted. But if `5` packages meet the criteria, then `1` will be deleted and `4` will be keep in the repository.

This value applies per group. So, the maximum total number of packages to kept will always be the result of `retention_count_limit` multiplied by the number of groups.

### Deletion order
Packages are deleted based on the date pushed, starting with the oldest and being newest packages the latest to be deleted until a total of `TOTAL_PACKAGES - retention_count_limit` packages have been deleted.

### Groupings
If grouping is selected, it applies to the rules to each "grouping". Otherwise, it's across all packages within a repository.

For example, if “Group Packages by Name” is selected, retention will apply to groups of packages by name rather than all packages. For example, when retaining by a count limit of 1 and you upload `PkgA 1.0`, `PkgB 1.0` and `PkgB 1.1`; only `PkgB 1.0` is deleted because there are two (2) `PkgBs` and one (1) `PkgA`. Or, If “Group Packages by Format” is selected, retention will apply to packages within package types rather than across all package formats. For example, when retaining by a limit of 1 and you upload `PythonPkg 1.0` and `RubyPkg 1.0`, no packages are deleted because they are different formats

## Examples

### Example 1

Delete packages older than 100 days.

To configure a retention rule in the UI that removes all packages older than 100 days, you would set the following:

- "Limit By Days" = 100
- "Limit By Count" = 0 
- "Limit By Size" = 0.0B (disabled)

By disabling count and size, it means it only uses the package age to delete.

### Example 2

Kept only 5 packages per format (python, docker, helm, etc.), that are not older than 100 days, are not tagged with `production`, have been downloaded less than 10 times and are violating some policies.

```shell
curl --request PATCH \
  --url 'https://api.cloudsmith.io/v1/repos/WORKSPACE/REPOSITORY/retention?=' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
    --header "accept: application/json" \
    --header content-type: application/json" \
    --DATA "{
        "retention_enabled": true,
        "retention_days_limit": 100,
        "retention_count_limit": 5,
        "retention_size_limit": 0,
        "retention_group_by_name": false,
        "retention_group_by_format": true,
        "retention_group_by_package_type": false,
        "retention_package_query_string": "tag:~production AND downloads >= 10 AND ~policy_violated"
    }"
```

### Example 3

Delete all packages that are more than 30 days old and do not have any tag.

```shell
curl --request PATCH \
     --url https://api.cloudsmith.io/v1/repos/cloudsmith-test/acme-prod/retention/ \
     --header "X-Api-Key: test-key" \
     --header "accept: application/json" \
     --header content-type: application/json" \
     --data "{
  "retention_enabled": true,
  "retention_days_limit": 30,
  "retention_package_query_string": "NOT tag:*"
}"
```

### Example 4

Delete all packages that are more than 60 days old and have less than 10 downloads. 

```shell
curl --request PATCH \
     --url https://api.cloudsmith.io/v1/repos/cloudsmith-test/acme-prod/retention/ \
     --header "X-Api-Key: test-key" \
     --header "accept: application/json" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data "{
  "retention_enabled": true,  
  "retention_days_limit": 60,
  "retention_package_query_string": "downloads:<10"
}"
```
