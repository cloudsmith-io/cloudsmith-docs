# Sorting Packages

---
## Sorting Packages via the Cloudsmith web app

At the top of each repository packages page is the sorting dropdown:

<BlockImage src={img48c5e893304d7a8fbac85d7a4b1eea00afca6e145f4b0914ccd9a2ba0d1b334d_repo_sort} alt=""></BlockImage>

The available sorting options are: 

- Name (A-Z)
- Name (Z-A) 
- Uploaded At (Oldest FIrst) 
- Uploaded At (Newest First)
- Size (Smallest First) 
- Size (Biggest First) 
- Total Downloads (Ascending) 
- Total Downloads (Descending)

Note that currently, the UI only supports sorting by one field at a time.

## Sorting Packages via the Cloudsmith API

Please see the Cloudsmith [API reference](/api/packages/list).

Sorting search results is simple with Cloudsmith. A collection of one or more fields can be supplied in CSV (comma-separated value) format, and the results will be sorted based on the order of the fields provided. 

## Sort Fields

| Sort By                            | Sort Field Example                                                    |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name (`name`)                      | `-name` (sort by name alphabetically)                                 |
| Format (`format`)                  | `-format` (sort by format alphabetically e.g. alphine, maven, python) |
| Version - String-based (`version`) | `-version` (sort by version, greatest first e.g. 1.2.1, 1.2.0, 1.1.0) |
| Status (`status`)                  |                                                                       |
| Size in Bytes (`size`)             | `-size` (sort by size in bytes, largest package first)                |
| Downloads (`downloads`)            | `downloads` (sort by downloads ascending e.g. 0, 10, 50, 1,000)       |
| Date (`date`)                      | `-date` (sort by uploaded time, most recent first)                    |

**For all fields you can use:**  
`-` to sort by descending order. (Example: `-date`, `-version`)

## A Short Worked Example

Suppose that you had the following packages:

| Name                   | Format | Size | Version | Downloads |
| :--------------------- | :----- | :--- | :------ | :-------- |
| cloudsmith-example-cli | Python | 722  | 1.2.0   | 500       |
| cloudsmith-example-cli | Python | 719  | 1.1.5   | 1000      |
| cloudsmith-java-app    | Maven  | 6910 | 1.0.0   | 2500      |
| cloudsmith-example-pdf | Raw    | 309  | 2.0.0   | 100       |

**To sort packages by size descending, your sort query would be:**

```
-size
```

Which would provide the following results

- cloudsmith-java-app, Size: 6910 bytes
- cloudsmith-example-cli, Size: 722 bytes
- cloudsmith-example-cli, Size: 719 bytes
- cloudsmith-example-pdf, Size: 309 bytes

**To sort packages by format alphabetically, with version descending, your sort query would be:**

```
-format,-version
```

Which would provide the following results:

- cloudsmith-java-app, Format: Maven, Version: 1.0.0
- cloudsmith-example-cli, Format: Python, Version: 1.2.0
- cloudsmith-example-cli, Format: Python, Version: 1.1.5
- cloudsmith-example-pdf, Format: Raw, Version: 1.1.0

## Sorting combined with Searching

Sorting can also be combined with querying. If you wanted to sort by most downloaded Python packages, your query and sort would be:

```
query=format:python&sort=-downloads
```

Which would provide the following results:

- cloudsmith-example-cli, Format: Python, Version: 1.2.0, Downloads: 1000
- cloudsmith-example-cli, Format: Python, Version: 1.2.0, Downloads: 500
