# Package Groups

---
Package Groups provides a per package view of a repository, as opposed to the default view for a repository which shows each individual version of every package.   This can be useful to give you an overview of the packages contained within your repository, especially if you have a large number of versions for each package. 

The Package Groups view groups packages by package format and package name: 

<BlockImage src={package_groups} alt="Package Groups"></BlockImage>

Where:
