# Customizing a Broadcast

The default Broadcast **color scheme** can be customized to match your organization's brand colors. To customize the appearance of your Broadcasts, click the **Theme Tab** from the Broadcasts Overview page.

Customizations are applied at the workspace level, meaning the theme will be consistent across all of your broadcasts. 

In the **Theme** tab, you can modify:
- **Logo**: Add your company's logo.
- **Colors**: Adjust the background, text, and accent colors.

Additionally, you can configure visible metadata for each of the three different user-facing broadcast pages:

- **Broadcast overview**: Customize the main broadcast page by showing or hiding the total package and download counts.
- **Broadcast page**: View key repository information for your broadcast, including its description, package count, total downloads, and license.
- **Package details**: Publish package information, including size, downloads, status, checksums, GPG signature, GPG fingerprint, upload date, uploading user, and the README file.
