# Command-Line Interface

The Cloudsmith Command Line Interface (CLI) is a Py2/Py3 text-based interface to the <a href="https://api.cloudsmith.io">API</a>. This allows users, machines and other services to access and integrate smoothly with Cloudsmith without requiring explicit plugins or tools.

## Installation

You can install the latest CLI application from:

- [Cloudsmith](https://broadcasts.cloudsmith.com/cloudsmith/cli/)
- [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudsmith-cli)
- [Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/cloudsmith-io/homebrew-cloudsmith-cli)

The easiest way is to use `pip`, such as:

```shell
pip install --upgrade cloudsmith-cli
```

Or you can get the latest pre-release version from Cloudsmith:

```shell
pip install --upgrade cloudsmith-cli --extra-index-url=https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/cloudsmith/cli/python/index/
```

### Installing with Homebrew Tap

Homebrew is a package manager that can be [installed](<https://brew.sh/>) and used in different operative systems (MacOS, Linux, and also Windows). To install the Cloudsmith CLI with Brew, add the tap first:

```bash
brew tap cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-cli
```

Then, install it with:

```bash
brew install cloudsmith-cli
```

And you should be able to start using it! If you need to upgrade:

```bash
brew upgrade cloudsmith-cli
```

For issues with the tap, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cloudsmith-io/homebrew-cloudsmith-cli/issues/new) or contact [support@cloudsmith.io](mailto:support@cloudsmith.io).

### Installing on Windows

The instructions below detail how to install the Cloudsmith CLI using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

1. Click Start on your Windows machine and type “powershell“
2. Right-click Windows Powershell and select to “Run as Administrator“
3. To install chocolatey, type the following command into the Powershell terminal:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; `
  iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

4. Close and reopen Powershell in Administrator mode.
5. Install the cloudsmith cli using chocolately:

```powershell
choco install python -y
refreshenv
choco install cloudsmith-cli --source python
```

### Getting your API Key

You'll need to authenticate Cloudsmith for any CLI actions that result in accessing private data or changing resources (such as pushing a new package to a repository). There are two ways to retrieve your API Key:

**1. Via the Cloudsmith web app**

Go to the [API Key](https://app.cloudsmith.com/settings/api-keys) page in your user settings to view the API Key.

**2. via the Cloudsmith CLI**

<Note variant="note" headline="SAML Single Sign On Users">
If you login to Cloudsmith via SAML, you will not be able to retrieve your API-Key via the Cloudsmith CLI, as you will not have a password associated with your Cloudsmith Account.  You will need to retrieve your API-Key via the Cloudsmith Website as described above, and then [configure the CLI](#configuration--setup) with your API-Key. We are working on improving this via SSO integration with the CLI. With the CLI this is simple to do. You can retrieve your API key using the cloudsmith login command:
</Note>

```
cloudsmith login
Login: you@example.com
Password: PASSWORD
Repeat for confirmation: PASSWORD
```

**NOTE**: Please ensure you use your email for the 'Login' prompt and not your user slug/identifier.

The resulting output looks something like:

```
Retrieving API token for 'you@example.com' ... OK
Your API token is: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

Once you have your API key, you can put it into your `credentials.ini` file, use it as an environment variable `export CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>` or pass it to the CLI using the `-k <YOUR_API_KEY>` flag.

For convenience, the CLI will ask you if you want to install the default configuration files, complete with your API key, if they don't already exist. Enter `y` or `yes` to create the configuration files. 

If the configuration files already exist, you'll have to put the API key into the configuration files manually, but the CLI will print out their locations.

***

## Configuration / Setup

There are two configuration files used by the CLI:

- `config.ini`: For non-credentials configuration.
- `credentials.ini`: For credentials (authentication) configuration.

By default, the CLI will look for these in the following locations:

- The current working directory.
- A directory called cloudsmith in the OS-defined application directory. For example:

**Linux**

- `$HOME/.config/cloudsmith`
- `$HOME/.cloudsmith`

**Mac OS**

- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/cloudsmith`
- `$HOME/.cloudsmith`

**Windows**

- `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\cloudsmith (Win7+, not roaming)`
- `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\cloudsmith (Win7+, roaming)`
- `C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\cloudsmith (WinXP, not roaming)`
- `C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Local Settings\Application Data\cloudsmith (WinXP, roaming)`

### config.ini

You can specify the following configuration options:

`api_host:` The API host to connect to.  
`api_proxy:` The API proxy to connect through.  
`api_ssl_verify:` Whether or not to use SSL verification for requests.  
`api_user_agent:` The user agent to use for requests.

The default config is:

```shell config.ini
# Default configuration
[default]
# The API host to connect to (default: api.cloudsmith.io).
api_host=

# The API proxy to connect through (default: None).
api_proxy=

# Whether to verify SSL connection to the API (default: True)
api_ssl_verify=true

# The user agent to use for requests (default: calculated).
api_user_agent=


# Profile-based configuration
# You can set as many additional profiles as you need to provide
# for different configuration environments (e.g. prod vs staging).
# Add your overrides in the sections and then specify one of:
#  * -P your-profile-name (as an argument)
#  * --profile your-profile-name (an an argument)
#  * CLOUDSMITH_PROFILE=your-profile-name (as an env variable)
[profile:your-profile-name]
```

### credentials.ini

You can specify the following configuration options:

`api_key:` The API key for authenticating with the API.

```shell credentials.ini
# Default configuration
[default]
# The API key for authenticating with the API.
api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>


# Profile-based configuration
# You can set as many additional profiles as you need to provide
# for different configuration environments (e.g. prod vs staging).
# Add your overrides in the sections and then specify one of:
#  * -P your-profile-name (as an argument)
#  * --profile your-profile-name (an an argument)
#  * CLOUDSMITH_PROFILE=your-profile-name (as an env variable)
[profile:your-profile-name]
```

## CLI Scripting

The CLI provides a powerful interface for interacting with your packages and repositories in Cloudsmith. However, some operations require additional scripting to achieve the required result. Please see the examples below:

## Copying/Moving Multiple Packages

The CLI supports moving one package at a time. However, it is easy to script a solution for moving multiple packages.

The following command will list all the packages returned by `YOUR-QUERY`. Extract the relevant metadata and run the copy command for each.

```bash
cloudsmith ls pkg YOUR-ACCOUNT/YOUR-REPO -q 'YOUR-QUERY' -F json \
  | jq '.data[] | .namespace + "/" + .repository + "/" + .slug' -r \
  | xargs -Ipackage cloudsmith copy package YOUR-DEST-REPO
```

<Note>📘 The destination is not qualified by a namespace (YOUR-ACCOUNT). This is because you can only copy/move packages from repositories within the same namespace.</Note>

<Note>
📘 You can remove the query (YOUR-QUERY) to target all packages. The only downside to this approach is that it might require multiple invocations if you have more packages than the page size limit.

It's possible to navigate pages using -p  and increase the page size limit to 500 using -l 500
</Note>

### Example 
The following moves all Maven packages named cloudsmith-api with version 0.21.\*  from `lskillen/test2` to `lskillen/test3` (Permissions permitting obviously).

```bash
cloudsmith ls pkg lskillen/test2 -q 'format:maven AND name:cloudsmith-api AND version:^0.21' -F json 
  | jq '.data[] | .namespace + "/" + .repository + "/" + .slug' -r 
  | xargs -Ipackage cloudsmith copy package test3
```

## Waiting for a package to complete synchronizing

The `wait_for_package_sync` function below will wait for a package matching the provided query to either complete syncing or fail.

For example `wait_for_package_sync "name:^foo$ AND version:0.0.1"` would wait for a package named `foo` with version `0.0.1` to either successfully complete synchronization, fail or time out after 180 seconds.

The full list of available search parameters can be found in [our documentation on searching and filtering](/artifact-management/search-filter-sort-packages).

```bash
get_package_identifier() {
    local query=${1:-""}
    cloudsmith list packages --output-format json --query "$query" "$ORG/$REPOSITORY" 2> /dev/null | jq '.data[0].slug' | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'
}

get_package_status() {
    local identifier=${1:-""}
    cloudsmith status "$ORG/$REPOSITORY/$identifier" 2> /dev/null
}

wait_for_package_sync() {
    local query=${1:-""}
    local total_time_limit=${2:-180}
    local identifier=""
    local package_status=""
    local total_time=0
    local identifier=""
    local package_sync_complete=1
    local package_sync_failed=0
    local sleep_time=10

    while [[ $total_time -lt $total_time_limit ]]; do
        if [[ -z "$identifier" ]] || [[ "$identifier" == "null" ]]; then
            identifier=$(get_package_identifier "$query")
            if [[ -z "$identifier" ]] || [[ "$identifier" == "null" ]]; then
              echo "Waiting for package .. (query: $query)" > /dev/stderr
              total_time=$((total_time+$sleep_time))
              sleep $sleep_time
              continue
            fi
        fi

        package_status=$(get_package_status "$identifier")

        echo "$package_status" | grep --quiet 'Completed'
        package_sync_complete=$?

        echo "$package_status" | grep --quiet 'Failed'
        package_sync_failed=$?

        if [[ $package_sync_complete -eq 0 ]] || [[ $package_sync_failed -eq 0 ]]; then
            break
        fi

        echo "Waiting for package status ... (identifier: $identifier)" > /dev/stderr
        total_time=$((total_time+$sleep_time))
        sleep $sleep_time
    done

    if [[ $total_time -gt $total_time_limit ]]; then
        echo "Timed out after waiting $total_time seconds for package to sync" > /dev/stderr
        exit 1
    fi

    if [[ $package_sync_complete -ne 0 ]]; then
      echo "Package failed to sync after $total_time seconds" > /dev/stderr
      exit 1
    fi

    echo "Package synced successfully after $total_time seconds" > /dev/stderr
}
```

# Troubleshooting

When upgrading the Cloudsmith CLI, you may also need to update the Cloudsmith API using: 

```shell
pip install --upgrade cloudsmith-api
```

If using a proxy with self-signed / internal TLS Certificates, you may need to point to your custom certs with:

```
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/converted/certificate.pem
```
