# Audit Logs

Audit Logs provide a log of events across your organization, such as [creating](/repositories/create-a-repository)/[deleting](ref:repos_delete) a repository or modifications to repository settings/configuration.

## Key Concepts

Clicking on a row in your audit log will expand to show more details.

Each entry in the log represents an event or a state change and consists of four main components.

- **Actor**: The object that performed the Action, such as a User, Service Account or System
- **Verb**: The verb (phrase) identifying "what_happened", such as `login`, `retention_settings_changed` or `token_created`
- **Action Object**: The object which was created, deleted or updated by the action.
- **Target**: (Optional) The object within which the Action was performed, such as a repository or account

## Searching / Filtering

You can Search and Filter the Audit Log using the search box at the top. You can also use boolean logic (e.g. AND/OR/NOT) for complex search queries.

### Search Terms

|Search By|Search Terms Example|
|:--|:--|
|Actor|`actor:some-user`|
|Actor Kind|`actor_kind:user` (user) <br />`actor_kind:service_account` (service account) <br />`actor_kind:system`|"
|Event Time|`event_at:>"1 day ago"` <br /> `event_at:<"June 21, 2022 EST"`|
|Event Kind|`event_kind:action` (action) <br /> `event_kind:create` (create) <br />`event_kind:read` (read) <br />`event_kind:update` (update) <br />`event_kind:delete` (delete) <br />|
|Event (Fuzzy)|`event:api_key` (api key events) <br />`event:entitlement` (entitlement events) <br />`event:login `(login events) <br />`event:package` (package events) <br />`event:retention` (retention events) <br />`event:service_account` (service account events)|

#### Field type modifiers (depending on the type, you can influence behaviour)

- For all queries, you can use:  
  `~foo` for negation

- For string queries, you can use:  
  `^foo` to anchor to start of term  
  `foo$` to anchor to end of term  
  `foo*bar` for fuzzy matching

- For number/date queries, you can use:  
  `>foo` for values greater than  
  `>=foo` for values greater / equal  
  `<foo` for values less than  
  `<=foo` for values less / equal
