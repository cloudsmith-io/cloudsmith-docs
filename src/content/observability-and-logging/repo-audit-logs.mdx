# Audit Logs

---
The Repository Audit Log is a timeline view of non-package (but typically administrative) actions that have occurred within the repository, such as creating/modifying repository [Retention Rules](/artifact-management/retention-lifecycle) or creation of an [Entitlement Token](/software-distribution/entitlement-tokens).
