# Bug Bounty Program

## Overview

Cloudsmith aims to keep its Service safe, and data security is of utmost priority. Suppose you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in the Service. In that case, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us privately and letting us fix it before publishing technical details.

Cloudsmith will engage with security researchers when vulnerabilities are reported to us, as described here. We will validate, respond to, and fix vulnerabilities to support our commitment to security and privacy. We won’t take legal action against, suspend, or terminate access to the Service of those who responsibly discover and report security vulnerabilities. Cloudsmith reserves all of its legal rights in the event of any noncompliance.

We are pleased to offer thanks and/or a bounty reward for vulnerability information that helps us protect our customers thanks to the security researchers who choose to participate in our bug bounty program. This will range from the public thanks to a variable monetary amount or loot (depending on our budget and the impact).

## Rules & Process

If you identify a verified security vulnerability in compliance with this Security Disclosure Policy (i.e. Bug Bounty Program), you can submit this to our bug bounty program with the following process:

1. You should determine if an exploit is _viable_ (i.e., practically possible).
2. You should also check to ensure it's not explicitly out-of-scope (see below).
3. Please feel free to report the exploit to us using the relevant information (see below).
4. We will let you know we received the disclosure and triage impact and then schedule a review.
5. The urgency for review will be determined based on the type and impact of the exploit.
6. It may take up to one month to triage, depending on how busy the team is.
7. Timeframes are typically hours for critical/high, days for medium and (up to) weeks for low.
8. Please do NOT send continual "any update?" messages; we get reminded automatically.
9. Any disrespectful communications to our staff including but not limited to frequent checkups on the status of a report will make the report ineligible for any award.
10. We will let you know if the exploit is viable and whether we accept it as a bug bounty (or not).
11. If viable and fixed, we will publicly thank you on our [Hall of Fame](/exploits-hall-of-fame).
12. You may also be issued with an award in addition to being placed in the Hall of Fame.
    1. N.B. if the same exploit is reported by multiple reporters prior to remediation, then the first valid report that documents the exploit will receive the credit.

<Note variant="important" headline="❗️ Unauthorized Cross-Account Access">
Please note that in _absolutely no event_ are you permitted to access, download, or modify data residing in any other Account or one that is not registered to you unless permission is _expressly provided_ by the Account Owner.
</Note>

<Note variant="note" headline="🚧 Monetary Award Tax">
If a monetary award is provided as a bounty, you are responsible for paying any taxes associated with the reward.  We are obliged by law to report any such awards to the tax authorities, so please make sure that you handle this appropriately.

## Severity

When we issue bug bounties, we assign them a severity level. This represents the level at which we assess the impact of the disclosed security issue to be, and it influences the bug bounty award. Please remember, any decisions for assessed severity and impact are final, and we reserve the right to determine them.

### Severity Level: CRITICAL

Vulnerabilities that score in the critical range usually have most of the following characteristics:

- Exploitation of the vulnerability likely results in root-level compromise of servers or infrastructure devices.
- Exploitation is usually straightforward, in the sense that the attacker does not need any special authentication credentials or knowledge about individual victims, and does not need to persuade a target user, for example via social engineering, into performing any special functions.

### Severity Level: HIGH

Vulnerabilities that score in the high range usually have some of the following characteristics:

- The vulnerability is difficult to exploit.
- Exploitation could result in elevated privileges.
- Exploitation could result in significant data loss or downtime.

### Severity Level: MEDIUM

Vulnerabilities that score in the medium range usually have some of the following characteristics:

- Vulnerabilities that require the attacker to manipulate individual victims via social engineering tactics.
- Denial of service vulnerabilities that are difficult to set up.
- Vulnerabilities where exploitation provides only very limited access.
- Vulnerabilities that require user privileges for successful exploitation.

### Severity Level: LOW

- Vulnerabilities in the low range typically have little impact on an organization's business.

## Timeliness

We endeavor to try and fix security bugs within the following timelines:

| Severity | Typical Mean Time To Fix (MTTF)   |
| :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| CRITICAL | Within 2 weeks of being verified  |
| HIGH     | Within 4 weeks of being verified  |
| MEDIUM   | Within 6 weeks of being verified  |
| LOW      | Within 26 weeks of being verified |

## Reporting

To start the reporting process, please share the details of any suspected vulnerabilities with the Cloudsmith Security Team by sending us the details to [bug-bounties+nospam@cloudsmith.io](mailto:bug-bounties+nospam@cloudsmith.io) (remove the `+nospam` to reach us). Please do not publicly disclose these details outside this process without explicit permission.

In reporting any suspected vulnerabilities, please include the following information:

- **Vulnerable URL**: The URL where the vulnerability occurs;
- **Vulnerable Parameter**: If applicable, the parameter where the vulnerability occurs;
- **Vulnerability Type**: The type of vulnerability;
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Step-by-step information on how to reproduce the issue;
- **Screenshots**: A demonstration of the attack to aid description; and
- **Attack Scenario**: An example attack scenario may help demonstrate the risk and resolve your issue faster.

## Reserved Rights

Cloudsmith reserves all rights to decide on scope, impact, and reward.

If another researcher has previously reported an exploit, only the first disclosure will be considered. However, you'll always have our appreciation, and we'll let you know if this happens. This often occurs due to the number of submissions that we get.

If we cannot replicate the issue, regardless of the timeframe between the report and our triage, we cannot award any bounties. We'll try our best to replicate this, but please know that we don't receive reports, so we fix them without acknowledgment.

Finally, regardless of the reason, we do not tolerate abuse or threats to our staff or company. We reserve the right to terminate and block all communication with such people. Everyone should acknowledge and respect that there is a Human being on both sides of every communication.

## Acknowledgement

Thank you for helping us make the package management world a bit safer.
