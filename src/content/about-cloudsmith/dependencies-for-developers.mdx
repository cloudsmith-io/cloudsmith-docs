# Dependencies (for Developers)

Cloudsmith allows you to manage all your software assets within a single platform. With native support for 30 package formats, no matter what you are developing; Cloudsmith can help simplify and accelerate your development pipelines.

We are building Cloudsmith to provide universal format support for all package types. Which is no easy feat, but we love a challenge. Along with support for more widely-used formats like Maven, npm, and Docker, we continue extending our coverage: our goal is to support developers no matter which technologies they are using.

## Manage Packages

Configure Cloudsmith for dependency management:

- [Upstreams Proxying/Caching](/repositories/upstreams): You can isolate your packages from unstable, community-driven public upstreams. Giving you control of what assets are available to your developers.
- [Package Retention Rules](/artifact-management/retention-rules): Automate the cleanup of artifacts that you don't use and keep your repositories in order no matter what's the package format.
- [Package Groups](/artifact-management/package-groups): Get an overview of all the assets in your registries.

## Secure your Packages

Configure Cloudsmith to provide security, compliance, access and permissions:

- [Access Controls](/repositories/repository-privileges#access-control)
- [Custom Storage Regions](/repositories/custom-storage-regions)
- [Signing Keys](/repositories/repository-settings#custom-rsa-signing-key)

Cloudsmith provides additional features and functionality, normalizing the interaction, data capture and analysis across all formats, all built on each formats native tooling.

## Integrate with any Continuous Integration tooling

Cloudsmith can integrate with any CI tool through a number of methods (first-class integration, API, CLI, or native format tooling).
